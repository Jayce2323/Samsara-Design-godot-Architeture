    COMMUNICATION,
    COGNITION,

IV.  GENERATORS (Systems That Emit Events)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Combat System
   - Trigger: Attack resolution (hit/miss/kill)
   - Verb Source:  COMBAT_VERB_DICT[weapon_type + outcome]
   - who1: Attacker
   - who2: Defender

2. Magic System
   - Trigger:  Spell effect resolution
   - Verb Source: MAGIC_INTENT_VERB_DICT[intent + energy_type]
   - who1: Caster
   - who2: Target

3. Social System
   - Trigger: Speech action resolution
   - Verb Source: SPEECH_VERB_DICT[speech_type + tone]
   - who1: Speaker
   - who2: Listener

4. Physics System
   - Trigger: Material state change (from magic or environment)
   - Verb Source: PHYSICS_STATE_VERB_DICT[old_state + new_state]
   - who1: Cause actor (nullable)
   - who2: null (objects not Actors)

5. Metabolism System
   - Trigger:  Threshold crossing (starvation, exhaustion, death)
   - Verb Source: VERB_CATEGORY_DICT (Daily Living category)
   - who1: Affected actor
   - who2: null

6. Crafting System
   - Trigger: Item creation/modification complete
   - Verb Source: VERB_CATEGORY_DICT (Manual category)
   - who1: Crafter
   - who2: null (item created tracked separately)

7. Movement System
   - Trigger: Tile transition
   - Verb Source: VERB_CATEGORY_DICT (Movement category)
   - who1: Moving actor
   - who2: null

8. Ownership System
   - Trigger: Item transfer, theft, trade completion
   - Verb Source: VERB_CATEGORY_DICT (Ownership category)
   - who1: Giver/Thief
   - who2: Receiver/Victim

================================================================================

V. CONSUMERS (Systems That Listen to Events)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Rumor System
   - Filters: witnesses. size() > 0
   - Action:  Create rumor from event. to_rumor_content()

2. Journal System
   - Filters: who1 == player OR who2 == player
   - Action: Add entry

3. NPC Memory
   - Filters: event in perception range of NPC
   - Action: Store for disposition/behavior

4. Reputation System
   - Filters: severity > threshold
   - Action: Update Fame/Prestige based on verb_category

================================================================================

VI. EVENT GENERATION PATTERN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each generator calls: 

EventBus.emit(UEGEvent. new(
    who1 = actor,
    what1 = [SYSTEM]_VERB_DICT[action_key],
    who2 = target,
    where1 = actor.position,
    witnesses = get_perceivers(actor. position),
    source = SourceSystemEnum.[SYSTEM]
))

Derived properties auto-calculate: 
- verb_category = VERB_CATEGORY_DICT[what1]
- sentiment = VERB_SENTIMENT_DICT[what1]
- severity = VERB_SEVERITY_WEIGHT_DICT[verb_category] × TARGET_IMPORTANCE_DICT[who2.class]
