		     6. Temperature	 Radiation/Heat [Though temperature is exprienced through touch, this will be split cognitetavily for Psyche-calcs]
		     7. ESP		 [All other Senses][Emotional State = Logos, Pathos, Ethos] Represents the sense of imagine/percieve reality and the mental link between the two (The ability of the mind to influence imagined/perceived reality)
							    [as Stat* Ability to make predictions or instinctual decisions/auto-regulation - Governs info output/& cast fail chance]
		For short-hand design mental attack will use Pysche targeting in the same way physical attacks use bodypart targeting [Since touch is a physical sense it will target a bodypart but will damage the sense]
		Psyche-Damage - Senses cannot be mentally destroyed and therefore wont lose or gain health. Rather each sense has a Tolerance level that functions as health. When Stimulated the current Tolerance is raised,
				If max tolerance is exceeded that sense is over\rwhelemed and becomes unreliable. When Deprived the current Tolerance is decreased, if min Tolerance is exceeded that sense is dimmed or disabled.

Macronutrient Absorption Rates [Digestion]

Carbohydrates (single source): Approximately 60 grams per hour (~240 kcal/hr) using a single transport mechanism (e.g., glucose only).
Carbohydrates (multiple sources): Up to 90-105 grams per hour (~360-420 kcal/hr) when combining multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., a glucose and fructose mixture at a 2:1 ratio).
Protein: The rate is highly dependent on the type of protein:
Fast-digesting protein [Lean protien](e.g., whey): Roughly 8-10 grams per hour (~32-40 kcal/hr).
Slow-digesting protein [Fatty protien](e.g., cooked egg): About 3 grams per hour (~12 kcal/hr).
Fat: Fat absorption is complex and generally slower than carbohydrate or protein absorption per hour during exercise, and it slows gastric emptying. While fat provides 9 kcal per gram, a high-fat meal takes much longer to process overall. 
The body is highly efficient at absorbing nearly all fat consumed over the full digestive cycle, but the hourly rate during physical exertion is lower than for simple carbs. *Base starting value About 1 gram per hour (~9 kcal/hr)
   

FORMULAS***
								Task Completion Time Calculation - " calculate - Skill effect on task"		

% 1. TOTAL OBSERVED TIME (The Raw Baseline)
T_{obs} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i

% 2. NORMAL TIME (Adjusting for Subject Skill/Performance)
T_n = T_{obs} \times \left( \frac{R}{100} \right)

% 3. STANDARD TIME (The Final Practical Estimate)
T_s = T_n \times (1 + A)

% WHERE:
% s_i = Time per individual step
% n   = Total number of steps (Task Complexity)

% R   = Performance Rating / Skill Factor (e.g., 100 = Standard)
% A   = Allowance Factor for fatigue/delays (e.g., 0.15 = 15%)






[Formula explanation: -The Estimation Formula The total estimated time is the sum of individual step durations, modified by a skill-based performance factor: 
			 	(T= [sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}] x [{1}{S})\(s_{i})-> (1\S)] 
				(Individual Step-Times): The average time estimated for each discrete step in the task.
				(n) (Task Complexity): The total number of steps in the sequence.
				(S) (Subject Skill): A rating factor where 1.0 represents the "standard" or average skill level.

 			- Refining Your Estimate To account for uncertainty or "minimum average time" (the best-case scenario), use these industry-standard methods: 
				Three-Point Estimation (PERT): Combine your best-case (optimistic), worst-case (pessimistic), and most-likely times to find a realistic average:
				(Estimate)= [O+4M+P]\6) 
				(O) is the optimistic (min) time, (M) is the most likely, and (P) is the pessimistic.

			- Normal Time Calculation: Professionals often use a Time Study Rating Factor to convert observed average time into "Normal Time" by multiplying the average time by a performance rating (Skill).
				Time Study Rating Factor (or Performance Rating) is used to normalize the time a specific person took to perform a task compared to the time a "standard" worker would take. 
				The Rating Factor Formula The rating factor is typically expressed as a percentage, where 100% represents a "normal" or standard pace. 
				[Rating Factor]= [Observed Performance]\[Standard Performance] x 100) 
				Rating > 100: The subject is working faster than the standard pace.Rating < 100: 
				The subject is working slower than the standard pace. 

			- Applying the Rating to Task Time To find the Normal Time 
				(NT)— the time an average worker would require—you multiply the average time you actually observed (OT) by the rating factor: 
				(NT= [Average Observed Time] x ([Rating Factor]\100]

			-	To calculate the final Standard Time (Ts), we combine the complexity of the task, the subject's skill (performance rating), and an allowance factor for human fatigue or unavoidable delays. 
				
				1: Calculate Total Observed Time Sum the individual times recorded for each step in the task sequence to find the total time actually taken by the subject. 
					(T(obs)=[sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}]

				2: Determine Normal Time Adjust the observed time based on the Rating Factor (R). This accounts for the subject's skill and effort relative to a standard 100% pace.
					(T(n) = T(obs) x [R\100]

				3: Apply Allowances for Standard Time To reach a realistic time that can be sustained over a workday, apply an Allowance Factor (\(A\)). This typically ranges from 10% to 20% to account for personal needs, fatigue, and minor interruptions. 
					(T(s) = T(n) x (1+A)

                 		The final formula to determine the subject's time to complete a task is:
					(T(s) = T(obs) x [R\100] x [1+A]
				Where: T(obs) is the sum of individual step-times.
					R is the Performance Rating 
					A is the Allowance Factor expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).


Social Sim- *Psyche explnin Magic doc

Major Note (specifically for code/cache considerations)- idea: Control through Single actors & character sheet. flow of all systems Intent->Expression->Reactions
							unecessary forward on philosphy so it doesnt haveto be restated: As much as content as possible should function through generation. all design i mapped around that which is why formulas do not and should not contain specific values. The generated world contains the values in the appropriate pieces (Chars, tiles, objects).
							The challenge is managing the load of generating/storing/and load said data points effeciently and coherently. Generation is themost theorectical therefore the easiest to tackle up front. if not explictly mentioned, "method for saving" (whether or not data should be saved) should be implied.
							Thesis: Information, and events are generated on "NEED TO(KNOW)" basis, unknown info remains ungenerated. Individually character sheets are pulled from for generation. ie. pc family pulled from PC card index. Pc companion family is the same. That doesnt spawn anything, just flags for generation in sceneraio where appropriate. i was gonna explain in greater detail but i ended up linking the rest of the systems and lost steam.

General princple of hierarchy - Like interacts with like. Individuals interact with individuals, kin with kin, states with states etc with Socioeconomic being the determining factor of who is interacted with in matters.
				[not a hard sim rule rather it means that whatever lvl of hierarchy an interaction is made at resolves that issue. if opposing clansmen fight, that is now an inter-clan fight]
				[Inter-status conflict normally resolve with the higher rank prevailing, unless found to be fradulent, immoral, ethically-lacking, factually wrong (dependant),or deceitful . resolution depend on morality of resolver]
				The hierarchical position, in relation to ones social-status is the main determiner for the cause of social interaction	.
				General structure is Ingroup/outgroup: strong loyalty/suspicion of rival clans but I reversed for the Subversive (individual who counters the norm/inverses one oe mor collective principals/goals) where Ingroup/outgroup: suspicion of peers/strong loyalty to rival clans
																	Deceiptive (individual who hides subversive or deviant nautre)
																	Deviant (individual who's goal breaks taboo )
																	Liar (Pa = compelled to lie(habit))(So = to manipulate for gain)(Na = Lies for Ego)
																		(Co = Small lies)(Oc = Lies to not be left out)(Imp = lies with out rregard for long term)
																		(Av = lies to hide private details or avoid conseqence/reaction)(Pro = lies to protect others)
																	Suspicion lvl (instinctual supicion of person based on witnessed behaivor and known info. 
																		Suspicion represents that charachters chances of being a Subversive, Deceiptive, Deviant, Liar, Charlatan, or Infiltrator  )
																	Pessimist (individual who responds negatively to positive speech-type)
																	Optimist (Individual who repsonds positively to negative speech-type)
				
				Goal-structure is inverse. Individuals have complex-goals and simple methods. As the hierarchy moves up the goals-become simpler/focus and the methods more complex
					*Ingroup-outgroup - as hierarchry lvl rise suspicion between unknown in group memebers rise. ie (situation with no proof, and out of character (action does not equal habit)) 
								inter-family suspicion 5-10% for known family member if outof character (action does not equal habit) vs
								20-25% suspicion for unknown kin; however if fellow Statesman:  20-25% suspicion for known Statesman and no other association vs
								5-10% suspicion known Statesman and kinsman (implies/ clansman) vs  50-70% suspicion for known Statesman and unknown clan

Social-Tracking - . 

	MICRO LEVEL (Individual → Family → Kin) - needs, preferences, and daily life happen
		(work is social)	
						Individual - Drives: hunger, safety, comfort, belonging, ambition, Social radius: neighbors, coworkers, peers,
						Family (Direct): Core functions: Support (resource sharing, protection, inheritance, early socialization (Early habit formation)
						Kin (Extended): Core functions: alliance building, marriage ties, shared reputation, shared obligations,

	MESO LEVEL (Clan → Religion(social)/guild(work)) - identity, tradition, and collective memory.

						Clan: Collective goals: survival, legacy, territory, propagation, Practices: naming conventions, rites of passage, marriage rules, alliances through marriage (incorparation of acceptable out-groups)
						Religion: Collective goals: moral order, cosmology, ritual stability, Practices: ceremonial food, funerary rites, fasting/feasting,taboos, 
								-Ingroup/outgroup:believers vs non‑believers (religious out group), sects vs sects (religous in-group/Clan-outgroup)

. 	MACRO LEVEL (State → Class/Status) - military/large collectivist-power, law, and economy

						State / Country: Collective goals: stability (Resource security, Territory management, Population control), Practices: taxation, military service, festivals, legal systems
								Ingroup/outgroup: citizens vs foreigners, guilds vs guilds, factions vs factions
						Social Status / Class / Stratification: Socioeconomic rating, Determines: who you can marry, who you can trade with, who you can speak to, who you can employ,who you can command
									Status is influenced by: Legacy (wealth, occupation/occupational success, lineage, reputation)- every individual social-structure has shared Legacy

Prestige - Percieved Combat ranking. Base on Weapon Skills/Moves -> Combos -> Multistage moves. Combos can be made freely, learned from others, or taught to those who want to learn, or learn through "Osmosis". Combos Shared with others have shared prestige lvl (tracked through Dissappation method)
            Prestige = Combat Score - Sum of all Combo Lvls [A combos prestige rating/stats only trained in actual battle against Npc and must have witness to move use Prestige gain - For every hit/attack of combo landed x dmg of attack, all combos gain prestige on win  [Loser Prestige - Victor Prestige = Prestige earned for each combo if x = 0 or less than "no change"]/ 
																			Prestige Loss - Whiffed [every hit/attack of combo missed x number of consecutive-attacks missed], all combos lose prestige on defeat [Victor Prestige - Loser Prestige = Prestige earned for each combo if x = 0 or less than "no change"]

*[Excessive gift giving, Batering with nothing in return, over Bartering intentionally, should trigger suspicion for pc actions specifically, but as general rule (prevents tactics like outright buying all food and waiting out a Siege)]				


*[Recruitment Party & Warband - Pc has 2 party slots Mainslot: Companions, Secondary: Mercenaries
											Slots:	Companions: Fuction as direct/party members [Might have to lower but set cap to 12]
												Mercenary: Hired units that travel with the Pc as allied units but do not generate-sim stats outside of function combat stats. [Might have to lower but set cap to 20]
													*Mercenaries can be hired as Companions to retain their paid role, and will "freely choose" whether to leave the player once contract is up. Mecenaries will automatically fill Companion slot if <_4 companions
														*As well Companions are Autonomous and can leave the party freely, or demand payment for joing you as a companion if they "see it as" mercenary work]
[Settlement-Building - Mercenaries also count as Workers. As long as their paid they'll do the job. Merc/Workers with : Slave or Servant tag can not be paid in currency and will take rations only. All party members must be fed.(Daily), though Merc/Workers or companions can be assigned to handle this as well
			Shared containers, area partitioning [unsure what it called but CDDA,Elin,Amazing CultSim all do it]] will be used to keep party and personal item seperate. Npcs will do the same. 

			Workers party and non party may settle the areas they're building but as settlers they'll only follow the one in charge, so if you build a farm that's leased you may get neighbors whose placement cant directly be controlled. (though gernetaion should/would ideally have a logic map)
			Security - The owner of a settlement/ments provides the troops for security through the party slots as well. Garrison spliting {into Standing-marching troops} can be handled by leaving troops with Substitute  who gains the other 50% party slots (just in case Sub is a companion with party already).
					Multi-settlement security: Same principle. Through "Diplomacy" you can ask a companion to swear fealty. once sworn they be granted land or a settlement of their own that you currently own or come into possesion of. 
									Companion gains the other 50% party slots and can operate an army and settlement as the Pc does.									
max-party cap = 1064 (player not included)-[Max party size for battles, if battle is long/deadly enough for reinforcement charge they will enter map from direction of travel of party and be counted as world adjacent to local tile-probabbly over explain]
	
				Companions gets party slots as well - Slots: Companion: 6 each
										Mercenary: 10 each


*[unsure if contradictory notes exist- hardrule- Companions and mercs do no have to be in vicinity to be in party. Mercenary slots are static. Non vicinity Companion slots are cached and replace with up to 6 new slots. new companions must be sent from vinicity (or outright dismissed from party)]
*[rule 2*- Mecenary/freelancer title changes with hired job role. Party companions can be interracted with Merc/freelancers cannot, but companions can be freely moved between the 2 slots. 
		Companions: act as friends (share indv group faction identity/unpaid/shared rewards), 
		Merc/Frees: acts as Guards (must already be part of faction, convert, or be made companion (for atleast 2  weeks[Social system can lower]) to share indv group faction identity)/Paid- system for ingratiating soliders][integrates soliders/labor]


*rumors/gossip: stream line solution.  all tracked components work like stats that update every individual interaction. if a charcter sees you kill it updates that witnesses morality (their view of you), get the raduis the pc opreated in over a day. avg # of ppl. avg social score for all categories. that will modify a dissaption rate and set how "long it takes for word to spread" or let the set the update rate
				per system rule, if witness is unknown, or known but current dispostion unknown, or Known current dispostion known and npc does not plan to speak of what they saw, the auto update skips and both actions are held in the buffer till the pc leaves "that npcs bubble"

The basic conceptual formula for the expected number of people you might encounter in a given range is: 
(E= D (x)A) 
Where: (E): Expected number of people encountered.
(D): Population density (people per unit of area, e.g., people per square mile).
(A): The area covered by your search "range" (typically \(\pi r^{2}\) for a circular radius \(r\)). 

Calculating the Probability of Meeting at Least One Person To find the actual probability ((P)) of meeting at least one person, 
assuming people are distributed randomly (often modeled using a Poisson distribution), the formula is: 
             λᵏ * e⁻ᶝ
P(X = k) = —————————————
                  k!
(P(X=k)\): The probability of (k) events occurring.
 (Lambda): The average number of events in the given interval (calculated as Density × Area).
(e): Euler's number (approximately 2.71828).
(k): The actual number of occurrences you are testing for (e.g., meeting exactly 1 person, 2 people, etc.).
(k!): The factorial of \(k\). This represents the probability of not finding zero people in the specified area.


Simplified Ratio Method If you are looking for the probability of meeting one specific person out of a total population ((N)) within a lifetime or specific timeframe, the basic ratio is: 
P=Interactions\Total-Population

The World Hierarchical Scale
Active (Embark) Tile: The smallest unit where actual characters and items exist.
Local Block: A 48 x 48 cluster of active tiles.
Region Tile: A 16 x 16 cluster of Local Blocks. This means one Region Tile contains 768 x 768 individual active tiles.

Chaos factor Note- Formula:

The most common ways to represent the Chaos Factor mathematically are through Lyapunov Exponents (to measure sensitivity) and Logistic Maps (to measure population-driven instability). 

1. The Sensitivity Formula (Lyapunov Exponent) This formula calculates how quickly a small change at the Micro level (e.g., a family dispute) can spiral into a Macro level crisis (e.g., social unrest). 
. 		THE SENSITIVITY FORMULA (Micro-Level Drift): λ = lim (t→∞) [ (1/t) * ln |d(t) / d(0)| ]
   		(Measures how fast a small Micro change spirals into a Macro event)
		(Lambda): The Chaos Factor.\(d(0)\): Initial distance between two social states.
		(d(t)\): The distance between those states over time.Interpretation: If \(\lambda \) is positive, the system is chaotic. Even a tiny "Micro" change will eventually disrupt the entire "Macro" state. 

2. The Feedback Formula (Logistic Map) Used to predict when a Meso-level group (like a Clan or Religion) will become unstable due to resource competition or over-population. 
		THE FEEDBACK FORMULA (Meso-Level Instability)
   		X_next = r * X_current * (1 - X_current)
   		(Measures when Clan/Religious growth triggers systemic collapse)

		(x_{n}\): The current state of the system (between 0 and 1).
		(r\): The "growth rate" or Chaos Parameter.
Breakdown of \(r\):\(r<3.0\): The system is Stable. Families and Clans are in equilibrium.
(3.0<r<3.5\): The system Oscillates. Social status and class conflicts begin to cycle predictably.
(r>3.6\): The system is Chaotic. Traditional hierarchies break down; bureaucracies and legal systems fail to regulate behavior. 

3. The "Compatibility Gap" (Structural Chaos) In social systems specifically, chaos is often measured as a Compatibility Gap between the layers of your tree logic. 
 THE COMPATIBILITY GAP (Macro-Level Stress)
   ChaosFactor = [ResourceDemand_Macro] / [SocialCohesion_Micro+Meso]
   (Measures the stress between State demands and Family/Kin stability)

High Ratio: When the State (Macro) demands more than the Family/Clan (Micro/Meso) can provide, the "Chaos Factor" spikes, leading to structural failure or revolution

A. Formula for Chances of Running Into Each Other 
	[Enounter Rate Formula - for Pc (Speech chance encouter rate - random attacks a rare and  understandale (animals, robberies, assassins)->
		with the exception being thug (layabouts, hired goons (since you may not know who hired-them or why [creatingown reason to investigate if you believe the game perates on logic and not random gen]))->
			so it follows most combat enounters will/should be intitiated through dialouge creatingthe overarching flow of all systems Intent->Expression->Reaction]
			[For npc determines event probability]

The document provides a formula to determine the expected number of people encountered (E) in a given area, using population density (D) and area (A):

E = D × A

*   D: Population density (people per unit of area).
*   A: The area covered by the search range (e.g., πr² for a circular radius r).

To calculate the actual probability (P) of meeting at least one person, assuming random distribution, the document refers to the Poisson distribution formula:

P(X = k) = (λᵏ * e⁻ᶝ) / k!

*   λ (Lambda): The average number of events in the interval (calculated as D × A).
*   k: The specific number of occurrences you are testing for (e.g., meeting exactly one person).

The probability of meeting at least one person is 1 - P(meeting 0 people).


How to merge Journal/Quest/Convo ( text parsing)

Nouns: subjects, people (by social hierarchy), items (by type/known value in journal), places (by location type), events, relational terms.
Verbs: actions, intents, requests, emotional cues.
Adjectives: mood tags, descriptors (stats/traits modifiers), stat generators (Logos/Pathos/Ethos hints), relational tone.
Keywords: skill tags, topic tags, mood triggers.


Light Mode:
Player picks Intent + Tone (e.g., Persuade, Intimidate).
Button-based.
Fast, turn-based resolution.
"Social Pokémon battle" pacing.
Used for quick persuasion, intimidation, simple bartering, casual social checks.
No parsing.
The default mode.


Deep Mode:
Continues through the journal after opening intents.
Player can switch freely between Light and Deep at any time.
Uses parsed words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
Optional, but provides mechanical benefits/bonuses.
Especially useful for specific bartering and relational detail.
Uses text input.
Parser activates, optionally showing small icons for bonuses (Logos/Pathos/Ethos).

Unlocks special moves (Hook B).
Expose Deception (triggered by probing motive/suspicion words).
Ask NPC Relational Detail (triggered by relational nouns/emotional adjectives).
Deep Mode Boosts Relationship (triggered by empathy/support verbs/personal topics).
Deep Mode equals skillful play and provides a roleplay bonus.

Journal stores topics as nodes (Bandit Camp, Missing Merchant, Trade Routes, etc.).
NPCs can "discuss" any topic they know about.
Player must log discovered topics/outcomes in Journal manually,by selecting from recent event [Output-log](Journal tab), 

Nouns -> topics, factions, items, people.
Verbs -> intents, actions, goals.
Adjectives -> mood, traits, stats.
Keywords -> skill tags.
Radiant quests generated from: NPC Goal, Obstacle, Location, Required Skill, Reward.
NPC goals come from personality/psyche/traits.

One step, low stakes, no continuity. Supports NPC's short-term needs. Examples: deliver message, gather info, fetch item.

Multi-step, high stakes, continuity across time.
Directly tied to NPC’s core goal.
Player becomes a helper, not a fetcher.
Examples: help NPC rise in faction, resolve a feud, achieve a long-term ambition.

									2 - [Clone: Clones are made of the select Element but functionally have the same skill as the player[Pulse determines the # of copies made.]

													Shadow-Clones:  A copy that possesses the user’s exact Body-Stats and Skills. Since Clone is copy of character Magnitude will determine Hp of Clone, with specific stats[denisty, volume] being set through the Nature-Modifiers. 
																Shadow Clones are capable of indepent operation and upon disperal break down into the element they are composed of. Futhermore the caster gains any aquired knowledge, and regains any VP unspent by the clone.
																	*NOTE: Ki pool (VP) is split between Shadow-Summons. Meaning 1 Shadow-summon = 50% ki for caster + 50% ki for S-s, 2 = 33.333% split and so on]
													Mirror-Clone: a specialized entity that acts as an extension of the user. The Mirror clone can act independently or mirror the casters movement. The Mirror Clone has its own Spell-set seperate from the caster. Health and stats are shared among the caster and Mirror clone
																*If Mirror-Clone is Summoned, a Contract is made and becomes the only Summon the Caster can call.]

	Every Level of Control (skill)	the character gains grants 1 skill point. Skill points can be used to create base spells.

Base-Spells - 	A Base spell consist of  one Intent [Including Engery-Type Modifier], one Spell-Type , one Activation-Method, and one Spell-Nature[Including Energy-Type Modifier] = Inital Cast 
	
Primary-Spells - Primary-spells are freely made from spells made from Base-spells and include all Focus effects to be applied to Base-Spell. Primary-spell components include any extra  Activation-Methods, or Spell-Natures. 
			This is also where cast-shapes and the shape modifiers are added to a spell. Primary-Spells can also function as Auxillary/Tertiary-Spells

Auxillary-Spells - Auxillary-Spells can be freely created. Auxillary-Spells can be Simultaneous or Secondary, where Simultaneous-Spells activate at the same time as the Base-Spell
			Secondary-Spells activate after the Base-Spell completes its first activation.
		        Every component added to a Auxillary spell has x2 Difficulty.

Tertiary-Spells - Tertiary-Spells are to Auxillary-Spells as Auxillary-Spells are to Base-Spells
		  Every component added to a Tertiary spell has x3 Difficulty

Spell-Nature - Spell-Nature is essentially "How the spell works". Spell-Nature is seperated into 2-Categories & 3 parts, (ie...if one wanted to interact with a pure element; Base-Spell difficulty = 3 from Spell-Nature Alone.)
			Method consists of the mechanism by which that Nature function while Compostion consists of Pressure, the Force generated by the Nature, and Vibration, the physically manifested effect of the Nature.

		For short-hand design mental attack will use Pysche targeting in the same way physical attacks use bodypart targeting [Since touch is a physical sense it will target a bodypart but will damage the sense]
		Psyche-Damage - Senses cannot be mentally destroyed and therefore wont lose or gain health. Rather each sense has a Tolerance level that functions as health. When Stimulated the current Tolerance is raised,
				If max tolerance is exceeded that sense is over\rwhelemed and becomes unreliable. When Deprived the current Tolerance is decreased, if min Tolerance is exceeded that sense is dimmed or disabled.

Higher hardness = Finer edge, Higher Edge retention, harder  to sharpen (ie. steel more like to chip), lower ductility. More controlled cuts, less pressure needed
Lower hardness = easier to sharpen, less edge retention, more pressure need to cut, higher ductility

Avg Sharpness ratings (Iron and steel) & Avg use case

Katana- 5-30 µm Unarmored/lighlty armored targets
Longsword- 10-50 µm Lightly armored to moderately armored opponents; cutting and thrusting
Viking Sword (Carolingian)- 10-40 µm Chopping against unarmored or lightly armored opponents

a sword with a 1000 micron (1 mm) edge radius could cut skin, but it would be very dull for a blade and require significant force, likely a hard chop or a forceful drawing motion, rather than a light slice.

Feature 		Covalent Bond							Hydrogen Bond
Basic Nature		Sharing of electron pairs between atoms.			Electrostatic attraction between partial charges.
Type of Force		Intramolecular: Holds atoms together inside a single molecule.	Intermolecular: Typically acts between different molecules.
Relative Strength	Very strong; requires significant energy to break.		Very weak; often cited as only 5% as strong as a covalent bond.
Requirements		Atoms with similar electronegativity (often non-metals).	*Hydrogen must be covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (N, O, or F).*

Gel-Hardness
While an official table does not exist, engineers use general reference points to compare these scales. Almost all materials measured on Shore scales (rubbers and plastics) fall below Mohs 3. 
Material Example 	Shore Scale Value	Estimated Mohs Equivalent
Gels / Soft Rubbers	< 40 Shore A	< 1 Mohs
Pencil Eraser	~50 Shore A	~1 Mohs
Shoe Sole / Tire Tread	~70 Shore A	1.5 – 2 Mohs
Hard Hat / Golf Ball	~90 Shore A / 50 Shore D	~2 Mohs (Fingernail level)
Bowling Ball / Hard Plastic	~80 Shore D	2.5 – 3 Mohs (Copper penny level)
Nylon / Polycarbonate	~85 Shore D	~3 Mohs
Why they are difficult to compare
Material Type: Shore scales are designed specifically for polymers (rubbers/plastics), while Mohs is used for minerals and inorganic solids.
Elasticity: Rubbers are "resilient"; they can resist a scratch (Mohs) but be easily indented (Shore). Conversely, a material like gypsum is harder to indent but easy to scratch.
Measurement Range: The entire 0–100 Shore A and Shore D ranges typically fit into just the first three steps of the 1–10 Mohs scale. 

Comparison of Common Materials
Material Type 	Hardness Scale	Typical Value
Soft Gel (Insole)	Shore OO	30
Gummy Bear	Shore OO	10
Hard Cosmetic Gel	Mohs / Shore D	~2.5 Mohs / 70-80 Shore D
Silica Gel (Solid)	Mohs	6
Talc (Softest Mineral)	Mohs	1

*Free-Body Model [For tracking Force-Source and Output][Need to review and further integration]

Godot 4.5, modeling a "Free-Body Diagram" (FBD) for a turn-based game involves creating a Force Accumulator script. Unlike real-time physics which resolve instantly, a turn-based FBD needs to store, inspect, and then process forces as discrete steps.
1. Data Structure: The Force Object
Create a custom resource or a simple class to store force data. This allows you to track not just the magnitude, but the source (e.g., "Wind," "Recoil," "Grapple").
gdscript
class_name GameForce
var vector: Vector2
var source: String
var type: String # e.g., "Impulse", "Constant"

func _init(v: Vector2, s: String = "Unknown"):
    vector = v
    source = s
Use code with caution.

2. The Accumulator Model
Attach a script to your units that manages a list of these forces. Instead of applying them directly to velocity, you store them in a buffer to be resolved at the end of a turn or phase.
Force Buffer: A list of GameForce objects.
Net Force Calculation: The vector sum of all active forces.
Resolution: In a turn-based context, you typically resolve these into a final grid displacement rather than continuous motion. 
gdscript
# Attach to your unit
var active_forces: Array[GameForce] = []

func add_force(force_vec: Vector2, source: String):
    active_forces.append(GameForce.new(force_vec, source))

func get_net_force() -> Vector2:
    var net = Vector2.ZERO
    for f in active_forces:
        net += f.vector
    return net

func resolve_turn_movement():
    var net_force = get_net_force()
    # Logic to convert net_force (e.g., 500.0) to grid tiles (e.g., 2 tiles)
    # Use your existing movement logic here to apply the result
    active_forces.clear() # Reset for next turn
Use code with caution.

3. Handling Tile-Based Constraints
Since you are using a grid, your FBD model must account for "Static Resistance" from tiles:
Static Friction: Ignore net forces below a certain threshold to prevent minor nudges from moving a unit.
Collision Feedback: When a force pushes a unit into a wall tile, you can "cancel" that component of the force vector by checking the TileMapLayer for collision data before final resolution. 


*Vector Travel & Plane Splitting Model To calculate velocity by plane, you must decompose the net force into Parallel (Tangent) and Perpendicular (Normal) components relative to your movement planes (e.g., floor, walls, or specific grid axes). Normal Component: The force pushing into the plane (used for friction or blocking).Tangent Component: The force along the plane (used for actual travel velocity). gdscript# Core math for splitting a travel vector by a plane normal
func split_by_plane(force: Vector2, plane_normal: Vector2) -> Dictionary:
    var normal_component = force.project(plane_normal)
    var tangent_component = force - normal_component
    return {
        "normal": normal_component,  # The 'Impact' or 'Compression'
        "tangent": tangent_component  # The 'Travel' or 'Slide'
    }
Use code with caution.2. Force-to-Velocity Conversion (The "Free-Body" Accumulator) In a turn-based system, velocity is a discrete calculation of \((\sum \text{Forces})/\text{Mass}\) applied over a "turn-step" rather than a continuous frame. Mass/Inertia: Higher mass reduces the resulting travel vector.Friction by Plane: Apply different dampening to the tangent component based on the tile type (e.g., ice vs. mud). gdscriptfunc calculate_turn_velocity(forces: Array[Vector2], mass: float, plane_normal: Vector2) -> Vector2:
    var net_force = Vector2.ZERO
    for f in forces:
        net_force += f
        
    var split = split_by_plane(net_force, plane_normal)
    
    # 1. Resolve Normal: If pushing into a wall/floor, it may be nullified
    var resolved_normal = Vector2.ZERO # Assume plane is solid
    
    # 2. Resolve Tangent: Apply mass and friction
    var acceleration = split.tangent / mass
    var turn_velocity = acceleration # This is your 'travel vector' for the turn
    
    return turn_velocity
Use code with caution.3. Structural Integration To integrate this into your existing movement logic: Force Collection Phase: During the turn, actions (recoil, wind, explosions) add Vector2 forces to a unit's force_buffer.Decomposition Phase: Before moving, use the split_by_plane logic against your tile's collision normals.Output to Movement: Pass the final turn_velocity to your movement function (e.g., your move_to_tile() or lerp logic). Godot 4.5 Tip: If you are using CharacterBody2D for your units, you can use the PhysicsDirectBodyState2D to query tile normals automatically without manual raycasting, allowing for more accurate plane splitting when hitting diagonal or irregular tiles.

	"1. Nouns: Number and Ownership
Nouns use inflectional suffixes to indicate quantity and possession. Khan Academy
Pluralization: Most nouns add -s or -es (e.g., dog → dogs, wish → wishes). Scribendi
Possession: Singular nouns add -’s (kitten’s), while plural nouns typically add only an apostrophe if they already end in ""s"" (kittens’). QuillBot
2. Verbs: Tense and Agreement
Verbs undergo constant morphological change through inflectional endings to match the subject and time. Sarah's Teaching Snippets
Third-Person Singular: Adding -s or -es to indicate present tense (e.g., I go → He goes). Wikipedia
Past Tense: Adding -ed or -d for regular verbs (e.g., walk → walked). YouTube: Introduction to Morphology

Compound Prepositions: Combining two or more morphemes into a single word. Scribd
In + to → Into
With + in → Within
Out + side → Outside
Participial Prepositions: Verbs modified with an -ing or -ed suffix that have evolved to function as prepositions. Scribd
