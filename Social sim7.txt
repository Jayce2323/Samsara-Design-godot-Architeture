Social Sim- *Psyche explnin Magic doc



General princple of hierarchy - Like interacts with like. Individuals interact with individuals, kin with kin, states with states etc with Socioeconomic being the determining factor of who is interacted with in matters.
				[not a hard sim rule rather it means that whatever lvl of hierarchy an interaction is made at resolves that issue. if opposing clansmen fight, that is now an inter-clan fight]
				[Inter-status conflict normally resolve with the higher rank prevailing, unless found to be fradulent, immoral, ethically-lacking, factually wrong (dependant),or deceitful . resolution depend on morality of resolver]
				The hierarchical position, in relation to ones social-status is the main determiner for the cause of social interaction	.
				General structure is Ingroup/outgroup: strong loyalty/suspicion of rival clans but is reversed for the Subversive (individual who counters the norm/inverses one oe mor collective principals/goals) where Ingroup/outgroup: suspicion of peers/strong loyalty to rival clans
																	Deceiptive (individual who hides subversive or deviant nautre)
																	Deviant (individual who's goal breaks taboo )
																	Liar (Pa = compelled to lie(habit))(So = to manipulate for gain)(Na = Lies for Ego)
																		(Co = Small lies)(Oc = Lies to not be left out)(Imp = lies with out rregard for long term)
																		(Av = lies to hide private details or avoid conseqence/reaction)(Pro = lies to protect others)
																	Suspicion lvl (instinctual supicion of person based on witnessed behaivor and known info. 
																		Suspicion represents that charachters chances of being a Subversive, Deceiptive, Deviant, Liar, Charlatan, or Infiltrator  )
																	Pessimist (individual who responds negatively to positive speech-type)
																	Optimist (Individual who repsonds positively to negative speech-type)
				
				Goal-structure is inverse. Individuals have complex-goals and simple methods. As the hierarchy moves up the goals-become simpler/focus and the methods more complex
					*Ingroup-outgroup - as hierarchry lvl rise suspicion between unknown in group memebers rise. ie (situation with no proof, and out of character (action does not equal habit)) 
								inter-family suspicion 5-10% for known family member if outof character (action does not equal habit) vs
								20-25% suspicion for unknown kin; however if fellow Statesman:  20-25% suspicion for known Statesman and no other association vs
								5-10% suspicion known Statesman and kinsman (implies/ clansman) vs  50-70% suspicion for known Statesman and unknown clan

Social-Tracking - . 

	MICRO LEVEL (Individual → Family → Kin) - needs, preferences, and daily life happen
		(work is social)	
						Individual - Drives: hunger, safety, comfort, belonging, ambition, Social radius: neighbors, coworkers, peers,
						Family (Direct): Core functions: Support (resource sharing, protection, inheritance, early socialization (Early habit formation)
						Kin (Extended): Core functions: alliance building, marriage ties, shared reputation, shared obligations,

	MESO LEVEL (Clan → Religion(social)/guild(work)) - identity, tradition, and collective memory.

						Clan: Collective goals: survival, legacy, territory, propagation, Practices: naming conventions, rites of passage, marriage rules, alliances through marriage (incorparation of acceptable out-groups)
						Religion: Collective goals: moral order, cosmology, ritual stability, Practices: ceremonial food, funerary rites, fasting/feasting,taboos, 
								-Ingroup/outgroup:believers vs non‑believers (religious out group), sects vs sects (religous in-group/Clan-outgroup)

. 	MACRO LEVEL (State → Class/Status) - military/large collectivist-power, law, and economy

						State / Country: Collective goals: stability (Resource security, Territory management, Population control), Practices: taxation, military service, festivals, legal systems
								Ingroup/outgroup: citizens vs foreigners, guilds vs guilds, factions vs factions
						Social Status / Class / Stratification: Socioeconomic rating, Determines: who you can marry, who you can trade with, who you can speak to, who you can employ,who you can command
									Status is influenced by: Legacy (wealth, occupation/occupational success, lineage, reputation)- every individual social-structure has shared Legacy

Influence - the "political currency" -> Essentially how much a factions individual members respect you, based on provided "support".	

 Influence Gain Formula

The formula for **Influence** gain per interaction incorporates a base value derived from the interaction's sentiment and a bonus determined by the hierarchy level of the interacting parties.

#### Step 1: Define variables

We define the following variables:
*   \( I_{gain} \) = Influence gained/lost from a single interaction.
*   \( S \) = Sentiment score of the interaction (\( S = +1 \) for positive, \( S = -1 \) for negative).
*   \( L_{initiator} \) = Hierarchy level of the character initiating the action (Micro, Meso, or Macro).
*   \( L_{target} \) = Hierarchy level of the target faction/character (Micro, Meso, or Macro).
*   \( B(L_{initiator}, L_{target}) \) = Bonus based on hierarchy levels.

#### Step 2: Define the Hierarchy Bonus \( B \)

The bonus value depends on the initiator's level and the target's level, as specified by your rules:
*   If \( L_{initiator} = \text{Macro} \):
    *   \( B = 3 \) if \( L_{target} = \text{Micro} \)
    *   \( B = 2 \) if \( L_{target} = \text{Meso} \)
    *   \( B = 1 \) if \( L_{target} = \text{Macro} \)
*   If \( L_{initiator} = \text{Meso} \):
    *   \( B = 2 \) if \( L_{target} = \text{Micro} \)
    *   \( B = 1 \) if \( L_{target} = \text{Meso} \)
    *   (Implied: \( B = 0 \) if \( L_{target} = \text{Macro} \), or interactions not defined)
*   (If \( L_{initiator} = \text{Micro} \), the bonus might be implied as 0 or 1, but based on the rules, it's not specified beyond Meso).

#### Step 3: Combine components into the main formula

The total influence gain is the base sentiment value multiplied by the hierarchy bonus.

#### **Answer:**
The formula is:
\[ I_{gain} = S \times B(L_{initiator}, L_{target}) \]
where \( S \) is the interaction sentiment (+1 or -1) and \( B \) is the hierarchy bonus defined by the rules above.



Prestige - Percieved Combat ranking. Base on Weapon Skills/Moves -> Combos -> Multistage moves. Combos can be made freely, learned from others, or taught to those who want to learn, or learn through "Osmosis". Combos Shared with others have shared prestige lvl (tracked through Dissappation method)
            Prestige = Combat Score - Sum of all Combo Lvls [A combos prestige rating/stats only trained in actual battle against Npc and must have witness to move use Prestige gain - For every hit/attack of combo landed x dmg of attack, all combos gain prestige on win  [Loser Prestige - Victor Prestige = Prestige earned for each combo if x = 0 or less than "no change"]/ 
																			Prestige Loss - Whiffed [every hit/attack of combo missed x number of consecutive-attacks missed], all combos lose prestige on defeat [Victor Prestige - Loser Prestige = Prestige earned for each combo if x = 0 or less than "no change"]
         Combo Stats = Stamina Cost- Stamina lost if Combo is completed flawlessy with no resistance
			  School - Name of fighting Style. Must Name style if unique (Styles with shared names from seperate creators will share prestige)
			  Master - Leader of School (Faction)
			  Creator - Character who made Combo

Prestige lvl - [Higher than Tracked prestige] = Skill level -> This is the social representation of your skill stat. It determines your percieved item/work quality, and influences you comes to you and why. 
        
		[Just in case it unclear Prestige track Pc's Social (percieved) Job and Trainer Lvl for NPCs -> As  a Pc would do inversely]	


Socialization -

Functions as more traditional turn-based combat. Can have random encounters. Affected by mood.

			stats - Pyshce: Logos, Pathos, Ethos - these represent the ability to reason and are your social resource. Every character responds positively (Enhances Friendly speech), neutrally(Enhances deception), and negatively(Enhances hostile effect) to one of these.
				
Convo flow (after initial intent) - 1. Initiator (set intent) vs Respondent (Free to set own intent/Resist[start battle]/or agree [conversation resolves])

*[Recruitment Party & Warband - Pc has 2 party slots Mainslot: Companions, Secondary: Mercenaries
											Slots:	Companions: Fuction as direct/party members [Might have to lower but set cap to 12]
												Mercenary: Hired units that travel with the Pc as allied units but do not generate-sim stats outside of function combat stats. [Might have to lower but set cap to 20]
													*Mercenaries can be hired as Companions to retain their paid role, and will "freely choose" whether to leave the player once contract is up. Mecenaries will automatically fill Companion slot if <_4 companions
														*As well Companions are Autonomous and can leave the party freely, or demand payment for joing you as a companion if they "see it as" mercenary work]
[Settlement-Building - Mercenaries also count as Workers. As long as their paid they'll do the job. Merc/Workers with : Slave or Servant tag can not be paid in currency and will take rations only. All party members must be fed.(Daily), though Merc/Workers or companions can be assigned to handle this as well
			Shared containers, area partitioning [unsure what it called but CDDA,Elin,Amazing CultSim all do it]] will be used to keep party and personal item seperate. Npcs will do the same. 

			Workers party and non party may settle the areas they're building but as settlers they'll only follow the one in charge, so if you build a farm that's leased you may get neighbors whose placement cant directly be controlled. (though gernetaion should/would ideally have a logic map)
			Security - The owner of a settlement/ments provides the troops for security through the party slots as well. Garrison spliting {into Standing-marching troops} can be handled by leaving troops with Substitute  who gains the other 50% party slots (just in case Sub is a companion with party already).
					Multi-settlement security: Same principle. Through "Diplomacy" you can ask a companion to swear fealty. once sworn they be granted land or a settlement of their own that you currently own or come into possesion of. 
									Companion gains the other 50% party slots and can operate an army and settlement as the Pc does.									
max-party cap = 1064 (player not included)-[Max party size for battles, if battle is long/deadly enough for reinforcement charge they will enter map from direction of travel of party and be counted as world adjacent to local tile-probabbly over explain]
	
				Companions gets party slots as well - Slots: Companion: 6 each
										Mercenary: 10 each


*[unsure if contradictory notes exist- hardrule- Companions and mercs do no have to be in vicinity to be in party. Mercenary slots are static. Non vicinity Companion slots are cached and replace with up to 6 new slots. new companions must be sent from vinicity (or outright dismissed from party)]
*[rule 2*- Mecenary/freelancer title changes with hired job role. Party companions can be interracted with Merc/freelancers cannot, but companions can be freely moved between the 2 slots. 
		Companions: act as friends (share indv group faction identity/unpaid/shared rewards), 
		Merc/Frees: acts as Guards (must already be part of faction, convert, or be made companion (for atleast 2  weeks[Social system can lower]) to share indv group faction identity)/Paid- system for ingratiating soliders][integrates soliders/labor]


*rumors/gossip: stream line solution.  all tracked components work like stats that update every individual interaction. if a charcter sees you kill it updates that witnesses morality (their view of you), get the raduis the pc opreated in over a day. avg # of ppl. avg social score for all categories. that will modify a dissaption rate and set how "long it takes for word to spread" or let the set the update rate
				per system rule, if witness is unknown, or known but current dispostion unknown, or Known current dispostion known and npc does not plan to speak of what they saw, the auto update skips and both actions are held in the buffer till the pc leaves "that npcs bubble"

Currency

1. Establish the Baseline Value
You already have the core baseline for your economy:
1 sila silver = 0.73 kg grain
This sets the purchasing power of silver in terms of the most essential commodity (food).
2. Determine Metal-to-Metal Ratios
Historically, the value ratios between precious metals were relatively stable but set by ruling authorities or market forces. The most common historical ratios were around 12:1 to 15:1 for gold to silver and approximately 40:1 to 50:1 for silver to copper by weight. 
For this example, we will use the Roman system's approximate ratios under Augustus: 
1 gram of gold ≈ 12 grams of silver
1 gram of silver ≈ 41 grams of copper 
3. Calculate Equivalent Values in Grain
Using the ratios and your baseline, you can now determine the grain value for all metals:
Silver: 1 gram silver ≈ 0.73 kg grain / (weight of 1 sila silver). If we assume a sila is a weight of, say, 11g (similar to a historical shekel), then 1 gram of silver ≈ 0.066 kg of grain.
Gold: Since 1g gold ≈ 12g silver, 1 gram of gold ≈ 12 × (0.066 kg grain) ≈ 0.79 kg grain.
Copper: Since 1g silver ≈ 41g copper, 1 gram of copper ≈ 0.066 kg grain / 41 ≈ 0.0016 kg grain. 
4. Determine Prices for Other Goods
The value of all other goods will be determined by their supply and demand relative to grain and metals in your specific market:
Labor: A day's worth of common labor might be valued at a certain amount of grain (e.g., 2 kg of grain) or its silver equivalent.
Manufactured Goods: The price of a tool would reflect the cost of the raw copper, plus the labor required to make it.
Luxury Items: Items like spices, fine cloth, or exotic materials would have prices driven by scarcity and desirability, expressed in silver or gold weight

func get_item_market_value(item, market_context):
    # Baseline: calculate weight in silver/grain equivalent
    base_value = item.weight * silver_value_per_gram * grain_value_per_silver
    # Apply all quality, condition, rarity modifiers (from item.modifiers)
    value_mod = ModifierSystem.get_total_value_modifier(item.modifiers)
    # Scarcity/demand: context from trade logs
    scarcity_mod = market_context.get_scarcity_mod(item.type)
    # Self-correction: average over all recent transaction values for this item
    # Final calculation
    true_value = base_value * value_mod * scarcity_mod
    return round(true_value, 2)

[Promotions are decided by Superiors. Leaders need PromotionRequirements-> that factor in personal dispostion]

To receive a promotion, a character (C) must meet or exceed a dynamic threshold set by the superior (S).

Character Faction Member Score = Fame Score + Current Prestige Level + Total Influence

Promotion Threshold = Superior's Prestige Level + (Superior's Influence/Superior's Dispostion)


================================================================================
                         RUMOR/GOSSIP SYSTEM
              (Shannon Entropy-Based Information Propagation)
================================================================================

I. CORE CONCEPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rumors are tracked as INFORMATION PACKETS with entropy values. 
- High Entropy = Fresh, valuable, actively spreading
- Low Entropy = Stale, common knowledge, or forgotten
- Entropy determines both SPREAD RATE and DECAY RATE

================================================================================

II. NEW TRACKED VARIABLES (Per Rumor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
var rumor_id: int                      # Unique identifier
var subject: Actor                     # Who the rumor is about
var witness_list: Array[Actor]         # Who has heard it
var witness_count: int                 # Total who know
var origin_actor: Actor                # Original witness/source
var origin_turn: int                   # When event occurred
var last_spread_turn: int              # Last time it propagated
var rumor_content: Dictionary          # UEG event structure (Who/What/When/Where)
var veracity:  float                    # 0.0-1.0 (how true it is)
var severity: float                    # 0.0-1.0 (how significant the event was)
var entropy: float                     # Current Shannon entropy value
var spread_probability: float          # Chance to spread per social interaction
var sentiment:  String                  # "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"

================================================================================

III.  SHANNON ENTROPY CALCULATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Base Formula:
   H = -Σ (p_i × log₂(p_i))

   Where p_i represents probability distribution across AWARE vs UNAWARE population

B. Rumor Entropy Formula: 

   p_aware = Witness_Count / Local_Population
   p_unaware = 1 - p_aware
   
   H = -( p_aware × log₂(p_aware) + p_unaware × log₂(p_unaware) )

   Edge cases:
   - IF p_aware = 0 THEN H = 0 (no information exists)
   - IF p_aware = 1 THEN H = 0 (everyone knows, no information value)
   - Maximum H ≈ 1.0 when p_aware = 0.5 (half know, half don't)

C. Modified Entropy (incorporating severity and time):

   H_effective = H × Severity_Mod × Freshness_Mod × Veracity_Mod

   Severity_Mod = 0.5 + (Severity × 0.5)          # Range: 0.5 - 1.0
   Freshness_Mod = 1 / (1 + (Turns_Since_Event / 72000))  # Decays over days
   Veracity_Mod = 0.3 + (Veracity × 0.7)          # False rumors decay faster

================================================================================

IV. SPREAD MECHANICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Spread Probability (per social interaction):

   Base_Spread_Chance = H_effective × Speaker_Charisma/100 × Topic_Relevance
   
   Topic_Relevance Modifiers:
   - Rumor about listener's faction: ×2.0
   - Rumor about listener's enemy: ×1.8
   - Rumor about listener's friend: ×1.5
   - Rumor about stranger: ×0.5
   - Rumor already known by listener: ×0.0 (no spread)

B. Spread Resolution: 

   IF Random(100) < Base_Spread_Chance × 100 THEN:
       Add listener to witness_list
       witness_count += 1
       last_spread_turn = current_turn
       Recalculate entropy (H decreases as more know)
       
       # Mutation chance (rumors change as they spread)
       IF Random(100) < (100 - Veracity × 100) × 0.1 THEN:
           Mutate_Rumor()  # Slight detail change
           Veracity -= 0.05

C. Mutation Types:
   - Exaggeration: Severity += 0.1
   - Minimization: Severity -= 0.1
   - Actor Swap: Subject changes to associated actor
   - Detail Loss: Remove Where or When component
   - Sentiment Flip: Rare, Positive ↔ Negative

================================================================================

V. DISSIPATION MECHANICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.  Dissipation Check (every 3000 turns / 1 hour):

   Dissipation_Rate = (1 - H_effective) × Base_Decay × Population_Factor
   
   Base_Decay = 0.01 per hour
   Population_Factor = Local_Population / Witness_Count  # Faster decay if few know
   
   H_effective -= Dissipation_Rate
   
   IF H_effective < 0. 05 THEN: 
       Rumor_State = "Forgotten"
       # Remove from active tracking, archive or delete

B. Crystallization Check (rumor becomes permanent Reputation):

   IF witness_count > Local_Population × 0.6 THEN:      # >60% know
       IF Turns_Since_Event > 504000 THEN:               # >1 week old
           IF Veracity > 0.7 THEN:                       # Mostly true
               Crystallize_To_Reputation()
           ELSE:
               # False rumor widely believed
               Crystallize_To_False_Reputation()
               Subject. Suspicion += 10  # People suspect something's off

C. Crystallization Effect: 

   Crystallize_To_Reputation():
       # Permanent modification to subject's social stats
       IF Sentiment = "Positive" THEN:
           Subject.Fame += Severity × 10
           Subject.Reputation_Rating += Severity × 5
       ELSE IF Sentiment = "Negative" THEN: 
           Subject.Fame += Severity × 5  # Infamy is still fame
           Subject. Reputation_Rating -= Severity × 10
           Subject.Ethics -= Severity × 2
       
       # Archive rumor content to subject's "Known History"
       Subject.known_events.append(rumor_content)
       
       # Remove from active rumor pool
       Rumor_State = "Crystallized"

================================================================================

VI.  RADIUS & LOCALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.  Rumor Radius (spatial spread limitation):

   Initial_Radius = Origin tile only
   
   Radius expands based on: 
   - Witness travel (carries rumor to new areas)
   - Market/tavern locations (information hubs, ×3 spread rate)
   - Messenger NPCs (deliberate spread, ignores radius)

B. Local Population Calculation:

   Local_Population = NPCs within (Witness_Radius × Spread_Factor)
   
   Spread_Factor by location type:
   - Isolated: ×0.5 (farms, wilderness)
   - Village: ×1.0 (base)
   - Town:  ×2.0
   - City: ×4.0
   - Capital: ×8.0

C. Cross-Region Spread:

   Rumors can jump regions via:
   - Traveling merchants (check every 72000 turns)
   - Military movements
   - Player character travel (carries known rumors)
   - Official messengers (for Macro-level events only)

================================================================================

VII. DISPOSITION & SOCIAL INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Rumor Impact on Disposition:

   When NPC learns rumor about another actor:
   
   Disposition_Change = Severity × Sentiment_Value × Relationship_Modifier
   
   Sentiment_Value:
   - Positive: +1
   - Neutral: 0
   - Negative: -1
   
   Relationship_Modifier:
   - Rumor about enemy:  Inverted (+Negative = good for me)
   - Rumor about friend:  Direct (+Positive = good)
   - Rumor about neutral: ×0.5

B.  Suspicion Generation: 

   IF Rumor contradicts known behavior of subject THEN:
       Listener.Suspicion_of_Subject += 10
       Listener.Suspicion_of_Speaker += 5  # Maybe lying? 
   
   IF Multiple contradictory rumors exist THEN:
       All listeners gain +15 general Suspicion
       Rumor with lower Veracity decays ×2 faster

C.  Gossip as Social Action: 

   Speech Type:  Narration (Neutral) or Mockery (Negative) or Praising (Positive)
   Psyche Stat:  Pathos (emotional rumors) or Logos (factual rumors) or Ethos (reputation rumors)
   
   Spreading rumors = Social interaction
   - Costs speaker 1 Pathos/Logos/Ethos (minor)
   - Success builds rapport (shared information = bonding)
   - Failure (listener already knows, or doesn't care): No effect

================================================================================

VIII. PLAYER INTERACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.  Player as Witness:

   When Player witnesses event:
   - Auto-generate rumor with Veracity = 1.0
   - Player can choose to spread or suppress
   - Suppression: Rumor only spreads if other witnesses exist

B. Player Spreading Rumors:

   Social Action:  "Share Information" or "Spread Rumor"
   - Select known rumor from journal
   - Speech check determines spread success
   - Player can deliberately lie (create false rumor, Veracity = 0.0)
   - Deception check if listener is skeptical

C. Player as Subject:

   Rumors about Player affect:
   - NPC initial Disposition (before meeting)
   - Recruitment difficulty (Fame/Infamy)
   - Shop prices (±10% based on reputation)
   - Guard alertness (negative rumors = higher scrutiny)
   - Quest availability (some require good/bad reputation)

D.  Rumor Investigation:

   Player can attempt to: 
   - Trace rumor source (Inquiry speech + Investigation)
   - Verify rumor truth (costs time, requires evidence)
   - Counter rumor (spread opposing information)
   - Suppress rumor (intimidate witnesses, costs Influence)

================================================================================

IX. UEG INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Rumor Content Structure (mirrors UEG):

   rumor_content = {
       "who1": Actor,           # Subject of rumor
       "what1":  Verb,           # Action taken
       "who2": Actor/null,      # Enacted upon (if applicable)
       "when1": Time/vague,     # Specific or "recently"/"long ago"
       "where1": Location/vague,# Specific or "somewhere in [region]"
       "sentiment": String,     # From verb connotation
       "severity": float        # From verb + context
   }

B. Rumor Generation from Events:

   When UEG generates event with witnesses:
   
   IF Event. witness_count > 0 THEN: 
       new_rumor = {
           subject: Event.Who1,
           rumor_content: Event.export_to_rumor(),
           veracity: 1.0,
           severity: Calculate_Severity(Event),
           entropy: Calculate_Initial_Entropy(witness_count, local_pop),
           sentiment: Event.What1.connotation
       }
       Active_Rumors.append(new_rumor)

C. Severity Calculation:

   Base_Severity = Verb_Type_Weight × Target_Importance
   
   Verb_Type_Weights:
   - Movement: 0.1
   - Daily Living: 0.1
   - Manual: 0.2
   - Interaction: 0.4
   - Communication: 0.3
   - Cognition: 0.2
   - Emotional: 0.3
   - Mental Intent: 0.5
   - Vigorous: 0.7
   - Ownership: 0.5
   
   Target_Importance:
   - Commoner: ×1.0
   - Notable: ×1.5
   - Noble: ×2.0
   - Ruler: ×3.0

================================================================================

X.  FORMULAS SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shannon Entropy: 
    H = -Σ (p_i × log₂(p_i))
    p_aware = Witness_Count / Local_Population
    p_unaware = 1 - p_aware

Effective Entropy:
    H_eff = H × (0.5 + Severity×0.5) × (1/(1 + Turns/72000)) × (0.3 + Veracity×0.7)

Spread Chance:
    Spread% = H_eff × (Charisma/100) × Topic_Relevance

Dissipation Rate:
    Decay = (1 - H_eff) × 0.01 × (Local_Pop / Witness_Count)

Crystallization Threshold:
    IF (Witness_Count > Pop×0.6) AND (Age > 504000 turns) AND (Veracity > 0.7)
    THEN → Permanent Reputation

Disposition Impact:
    ΔDisposition = Severity × Sentiment_Value × Relationship_Mod

================================================================================

XI.  BUFFER SYSTEM (Performance Optimization)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Active Rumor Cap:
   - Max 100 active rumors per region
   - Oldest/lowest entropy rumors purged first
   - Crystallized rumors archived, not actively tracked

B. Update Frequency:
   - Entropy recalculation:  Every 3000 turns (1 hour)
   - Spread checks: Only during social interactions
   - Dissipation:  Batch process every 72000 turns (1 day)

C. Player Proximity Priority:
   - Rumors in player's region: Full simulation
   - Adjacent regions:  Simplified spread (aggregate)
   - Distant regions: Snapshot only (update on player arrival)

RR = [(Resilience × 0.4) + (Aptitude × 0.4) + (Charisma × 0.2)] / 10

Disposition_Change = (Base_Calculation) / (1 + RR × 0.5)
