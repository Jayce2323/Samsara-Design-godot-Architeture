How to merge Journal/Quest/Convo ( text parsing)

Nouns: subjects, people (by social hierarchy), items (by type/known value in journal), places (by location type), events, relational terms.
Verbs: actions, intents, requests, emotional cues.
Adjectives: mood tags, descriptors (stats/traits modifiers), stat generators (Logos/Pathos/Ethos hints), relational tone.
Keywords: skill tags, topic tags, mood triggers.


Light Mode:
Player picks Intent + Tone (e.g., Persuade, Intimidate).
Button-based.
Fast, turn-based resolution.
"Social Pokémon battle" pacing.
Used for quick persuasion, intimidation, simple bartering, casual social checks.
No parsing.
The default mode.


Deep Mode:
Continues through the journal after opening intents.
Player can switch freely between Light and Deep at any time.
Uses parsed words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
Optional, but provides mechanical benefits/bonuses.
Especially useful for specific bartering and relational detail.
Uses text input.
Parser activates, optionally showing small icons for bonuses (Logos/Pathos/Ethos).

Unlocks special moves (Hook B).
Expose Deception (triggered by probing motive/suspicion words).
Ask NPC Relational Detail (triggered by relational nouns/emotional adjectives).
Deep Mode Boosts Relationship (triggered by empathy/support verbs/personal topics).
Deep Mode equals skillful play and provides a roleplay bonus.

Journal stores topics as nodes (Bandit Camp, Missing Merchant, Trade Routes, etc.).
NPCs can "discuss" any topic they know about.
Player must log discovered topics/outcomes in Journal manually,by selecting from recent event [Output-log](Journal tab), 

Nouns -> topics, factions, items, people.
Verbs -> intents, actions, goals.
Adjectives -> mood, traits, stats.
Keywords -> skill tags.
Radiant quests generated from: NPC Goal, Obstacle, Location, Required Skill, Reward.
NPC goals come from personality/psyche/traits.

One step, low stakes, no continuity. Supports NPC's short-term needs. Examples: deliver message, gather info, fetch item.

Multi-step, high stakes, continuity across time.
Directly tied to NPC’s core goal.
Player becomes a helper, not a fetcher.
Examples: help NPC rise in faction, resolve a feud, achieve a long-term ambition.


Core Crafting Methods
The system is divided into three primary categories based on the equipment required: 
Survival Crafting: Accessible anywhere through your inventory menu. It requires no special station and is used for basic gear like bandages, primitive weapons, torches, and decrafting equipment into raw materials.
Cooking: Performed at a Campfire (for basic roasting), a Cooking Pot, or a Kitchen. Cooking provides essential status-buffing foods that offer health, stamina, or mana regeneration.
Alchemy: Requires an Alchemy Kit placed over a fire. This is used to brew powerful potions, elixirs, and elemental varnishes. 
Key Mechanics
Manual vs. Recipe Crafting: You can craft items by selecting a learned recipe from a list or by manually placing ingredients in slots. If you manually discover a valid combination, you permanently learn that recipe.
Recipe Acquisition: Recipes can be purchased from merchants, found as loot in Recipe Scrolls, or shared by other players.
Trial and Error: If you attempt a manual recipe and fail, you lose all the ingredients used.
Decrafting: You can break down most weapons and armor into basic resources (like iron or palladium scraps) by placing a single item in the manual survival crafting screen

flow of battles-
Battles occur on a grid map, each grid space is made of 3x3 cells (9 squares) for thepurpos of tracking foot movement.
Instead of using initiative and turn order all moves are selected and played out in the same turn
Each turn represents 6 secs, each move selected during a turn will have an associated time and stamina cost
Recieving a blow, even if no damge is taken will also have a stamina cost
Attackers start the battle with weapons at the neutral position or a mid level defensfive stance, and select to defend, move, or target body part to attack
Each characters base Swing speed, Accuracy, and Evasion are calculated and each parties moves per turn are weighted played against the oppenents in the order selected 
The character with the higher swing speed will be counted as attacker first turn and and every other after(1,3,5). The slower character will be counted as attacker for the second action turn and every other turn after (2,4,6)
To determine if an attack succeeds, the attackers Accuracy(to-hit-chance(attack speed+ Perception modifier))+1d20 - defenders Evasion(dodge chance(Attack speed )
While attacking the player and enemy both have a chance to avoid damage based on evasion chance
Evasion base total is the character dex and perceptions bonus added together with modifers based on attack direction and the position of the targeted body part
Armor has a slight penalty to evasion chance (my goal is to only to only have the penalty become a real factor when a character is injured)
If the defender succeeds the evasion roll and is attacking with a srtike from the oppsing direction of the attacker a 1d8 is rolled for parry chance and added to the defenders attack speed.
A success is obtained if the defenders attack speed + 1d8 = +1 - or higher than the attackers attacked speed. At +1-+3 a parry is intiated and the next attack is a guarenteed crit. If +4 or higher a riposte is initiated the the current attack 
If the defender fails the parry roll with attack speed + 1d8 = attacker speed up to -2 attacker speed a sword bind will be initiated
During a sword bind niether party will be able to complete an attack starting from the turn the bind was initiated. Instead, the attacker and defender roll a 1d20 each turn until one player rolls at least +3 higher than their opponent
After which the succeeding party will continue their action phase with a guarenteed critical strike. If niether party succeeds a roll during the bind and the action phase ends the parties will reset to neutral and begin the next preperation phase.
if both characters succeed an evasion roll a parry roll will be initiated.
if no evasion is roll is succesful both characters will take damage if the attacker fails to interrupt their opponent(hit-trade)
