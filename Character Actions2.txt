How to merge Journal/Quest/Convo ( text parsing)

Nouns: subjects, people (by social hierarchy), items (by type/known value in journal), places (by location type), events, relational terms.
Verbs: actions, intents, requests, emotional cues.
Adjectives: mood tags, descriptors (stats/traits modifiers), stat generators (Logos/Pathos/Ethos hints), relational tone.
Keywords: skill tags, topic tags, mood triggers.


Light Mode:
Player picks Intent + Tone (e.g., Persuade, Intimidate).
Button-based.
Fast, turn-based resolution.
"Social Pokémon battle" pacing.
Used for quick persuasion, intimidation, simple bartering, casual social checks.
No parsing.
The default mode.


Deep Mode:
Continues through the journal after opening intents.
Player can switch freely between Light and Deep at any time.
Uses parsed words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
Optional, but provides mechanical benefits/bonuses.
Especially useful for specific bartering and relational detail.
Uses text input.
Parser activates, optionally showing small icons for bonuses (Logos/Pathos/Ethos).

Unlocks special moves (Hook B).
Expose Deception (triggered by probing motive/suspicion words).
Ask NPC Relational Detail (triggered by relational nouns/emotional adjectives).
Deep Mode Boosts Relationship (triggered by empathy/support verbs/personal topics).
Deep Mode equals skillful play and provides a roleplay bonus.

Journal stores topics as nodes (Bandit Camp, Missing Merchant, Trade Routes, etc.).
NPCs can "discuss" any topic they know about.
Player must log discovered topics/outcomes in Journal manually,by selecting from recent event [Output-log](Journal tab), 

Nouns -> topics, factions, items, people.
Verbs -> intents, actions, goals.
Adjectives -> mood, traits, stats.
Keywords -> skill tags.
Radiant quests generated from: NPC Goal, Obstacle, Location, Required Skill, Reward.
NPC goals come from personality/psyche/traits.

One step, low stakes, no continuity. Supports NPC's short-term needs. Examples: deliver message, gather info, fetch item.

Multi-step, high stakes, continuity across time.
Directly tied to NPC’s core goal.
Player becomes a helper, not a fetcher.
Examples: help NPC rise in faction, resolve a feud, achieve a long-term ambition.
