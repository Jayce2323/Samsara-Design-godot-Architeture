Limb Integrity (Links Limb/Total Health, Lifeforce, Chakra Points, & Meridians-> Calculates Pain lvls) = [[BodyPart-Hp% (x)(char)Mass(total)]*[[(BodyPart-Organ)(x)(Organ Weight Distribution %)] x Tissue kcal Distribution]
														= The Amount of kcals currently contained in a limb. Damage to limbs must be repaired with kcals. 
	Track Body Parts													Buffing Limbs requires kcals. The Force of internal effects are resisted in kcals
	Limb Integrity = The kcal of specific body parts
	Current Limb Integrity = The kcal of specific body parts
	Max Limb Integrity = Maximum instanstaneous kcal injection a limb can withstand before energy of change must be resisted with Will.= [Limb Integrity + 3,500] x Limb Skill
	Chakra Points = Qi is Aether as kcals that is controlled by Chakra Points (heart) and Meridians/Leylines (Arteries/Veins). Each Chakra Point contains the kcals of its associated limb.
			= [Cumulative Max Limb Integrity], Meaning Earth = Earth + Metal + Wood = Root [Starting size/stats = Organs]
	Dantian - [size(base, current), capacity(current, max)],[Starting size/stats = Stomach]
  	Meridians - current volume, max volume,			[Starting size/stats = Arteries and veins] 
	Golden-Core- Refractive index of the material, 		[Starting size/stats = determined during formation]
	Nascent Soul-kcal count(Qi)				[Starting size/stats = determined during formation]





Values to determine stats for weapon/armor
	
	Hardness- materials resistance to scratching and deforemation
	Sharpness- Materials edge fineness,edge radius measured in micrometers {µm} 
	Edge Retention- Materials ability to hold and retain an edge
	Ductility- Materials untensil strength as a measure of ductility and malleabilty (how much force the item can absorb before structural deformity) (Inverse Mohs Harrdnes - 10 least ductile - 1 most ductile)
