CANOPY_HEIGHT_MAP:

# 1. CLIMATE HEIGHT RANGES (The Base Variable)
# Determined by [Water_Content + Heat_Score] interaction within the ClimateEnum.

[TROPICAL / SUBTROPICAL] 
- Requirement: [Water_Content + Heat_Score] ≥ 25
- Range: 22.0m - 35.0m (Subtropical leans toward lower bound; Tropical toward upper)
- 4x4 Render: High Density (12-16/16). Multi-layer sprite stacks (Understory + Emergent).

[TEMPERATE_HUMID / MEDITERRANEAN]
- Requirement: High Water_Content + Moderate/High Heat
- Range: 20.0m - 30.5m (Humid can spike to 40m+ in Coastal variants)
- 4x4 Render: High Density (10-14/16). Large crown Hardwood/Conifer sprites.

[TEMPERATE]
- Requirement: Moderate Water_Content + Moderate Heat
- Range: 15.0m - 25.0m
- 4x4 Render: Moderate Density (8-12/16). Balanced mix of deciduous/evergreen.

[ARID]
- Requirement: [WIND_SCORE = -1] + [Heat_Score > 10] (High Heat / Low Water)
- Range: 5.0m - 12.0m 
- 4x4 Render: Sparse/Bimodal (2-6/16). Clumped Succulent and Dry-Shrub sprites.

[ARCTIC]
- Requirement: [BaseTile_HeatScore] < 2 (Maximum Heat Sink)
- Range: 0.27m - 5.0m
- 4x4 Render: Ground-cover (Moss/Algae). Sparse, low-profile Taiga/Tundra sprites.

[AQUATIC]
- Requirement: [Liquid_Height] > 0
- Range: 0.0m - 5.0m (Submerged/Surface)
- 4x4 Render: Water-Fern/Algae sprites. Height is restricted by Depth/Shallows score.


# 2. HEMISPHERIC DRIFT MODIFIERS (The Scaling Rule)
# Uses [BaseEquator_HeatScore] and [Latitude] to apply quadratic variance.

[SOUTHERN_HEMISPHERE] (Latitude < 0)
- Rule: Strong Latitudinal Dependence (R² = 67.1%)
- Calculation: Final_Height = Base_Height * (1.0 - (Latitude^2))
- Result: Predictable, sharp decline in canopy height as you move toward the South Pole.

[NORTHERN_HEMISPHERE] (Latitude > 0)
- Rule: Localized Climate Relationship (R² = 35.3%)
- Calculation: Final_Height = Base_Height * (0.67 + (Local_Moisture_Modifier * 0.33))
- Result: Greater variance; local "Heat Pockets" (like Mediterranean zones) can maintain height despite higher latitude.
