1. Autosomes (Pairs 1–22)
These carry instructions for general body development and functions[affects Max lvl treshold]. 
Chromosome 1: Power = Strength + Dexterity = How much force the character generates
Chromosome 2: Accuracy = Perception + Dexterity = Charcters hand eye coordination skill
Chromosome 3: Charisma = Perception + Intellingence = Characters social awareness 
Chromosome 4: Stamina = Strength + Endurance = The amount of energy a character can exert at once 
Chromosome 5: Toughness = Willpower + Strength = How much damage a characters body can absorb
Chromosome 6: Quickness = Dexterity + Endurance = How well the character can navigate spacial movement
Chromosome 7: Resilience = Willpower + Percpetion = How well the character can guard against mental attacks &/or recover from them.
Chromosome 8: Muscle Memory = (Intelligence + Endurance + Dexterity)/1.5 = Governs skill retention and potential 
Chromosome 9: Aptitude = (Intelligence + Willpower + Perception)/1.5= How well the character can learn a skill, execute, and or strategize 
Chromosome 10: Constitution/Lifeforce [Qi/Ki/Chakra] = Willpower + Endurance = Represents the characters pysche and body (soul).
Chromosome 11: Metabolism - fat and Muscle threshold
Chromosome 23: Sex Chromosome

[Trait Rolling & Genetic-Mutations - For Pc/on char-creation Chromosome slots are filled in order [random or by player].

		and Accuracy = Disadvantage
		Chance Mutations = Genes roll with _,_,_,or_ tags. If gene tag = natural state & "Chance Mutation" is rolled successful -> Mutation is summed/scored & stored (ex.+5% Power, +5% Constitution,=+10) until Chromosome 22 is rolled.
					-> After Chromosome 22 is rolled the "Chance Mutation" with the highest score checked for tag -> If trait = Dominant - trait is applied, Recessive - requires both parents
																			De-novo - Chance roll, X-Linked & male - apply (+Female for High Fantasy mode)
					->If first "Chance Mutation trait" ≠ Dominant, check for next trait until Chromosome 22 or dominant trait is found. 
					->If Dominant trait found, apply trait to Chromosome 22 (if from dfferent slot), and re-roll old slot. [Only applies Advantage/disadvantage & slot %. {Change slot rule not applied}]
					->If more than 1 Dominant trait found, apply highest score trait to Chromosome 22 (if from dfferent slot), and re-roll old slot.->Roll remaining mutations for proc-chance

MODULE: SpawnManager
PURPOSE:
    - Determine where, when, and under what world-state conditions
      a character (Player or NPC) enters the simulation.
    - Does NOT modify character data.
    - Does NOT override world systems.
    - Only coordinates between world state + character state.

2. WorldState
    - CurrentTime
    - CurrentWeather
    - RegionMap
    - TileMap
    - FactionTerritories

    - SpawnPoints (tagged)

3. ScenarioData (optional)

----------------------------------------
III. CORE LOGIC FLOW
----------------------------------------

FUNCTION SpawnCharacter(CharacterData, WorldState, ScenarioData):

    STEP 3: Validate Tile
        WHILE tile is invalid:

    STEP 4: Determine Spawn Time
        time = WorldState.CurrentTime

    STEP 5: Determine Spawn Weather
        weather = WorldState.CurrentWeather

    STEP 6: Determine Spawn Context Tags
