								For every +2 Couragessness earns gain +1 Confidence. "Action Failure" inflicts -4 dmg per event on Confidence. Confidence Homeostasis inactive until Courage is atleast 0 if +]
									Food Score is directly applied here.
"Sucessfull action" -> Action = Expected outcome -> ex. Crafting Success, Dmg Dealt, Trade made
"Positive interactions"-> Positive Speech Dmg
"Negative interactions" -> Negative Speech Dmg
"Action Failure" -> Action ≠ Expected outcome -> Player sets crafting timer to end beforecraft finishes, Missed attacks, Taking Dmg, Failed trades
"Craft-Timer" -> Time player expects it takes to craft 1 of selected item at current skill lvl

	[Sense & Rationale Tracking - e.states "hp" starts at 0, + attack raise hp, - attacks lower hp. Applies to both speech and mental attacks.}		

	ESP & Sense- Esp Represents the sense of imagine/percieve reality and the mental link between the two (The ability of the mind to influence imagined/perceived reality).
			Senses 1-6 - Follow Rationale logic for damage and simulation. Sense 7 [ESP] - is the only sense with proper "hp" score. "Attacks" + or -.
			Mental Attack calc = Spell effect dmg - Enemy-Resilience = Pen check-> Pen-check - ESP = Mental dmg taken [MDT] -> MDT x 10 = Damage to targeted Sense
			Speech combat does not effect ESP or Sense.
    
		For short-hand design mental attack will use Pysche targeting in the same way physical attacks use bodypart targeting [Since touch is a physical sense it will target a bodypart but will damage the sense]
		Psyche-Damage - Senses cannot be mentally destroyed and therefore wont lose or gain health. Rather each sense has a Tolerance level that functions as health. When Stimulated the current Tolerance is raised,
				If max tolerance is exceeded that sense is overrwhelemed and becomes unreliable. When Deprived the current Tolerance is decreased, if min Tolerance is exceeded that sense is dimmed or disabled.

											*Muscle Gain & Loss System*

				MUSCLE GAIN
	Triggered by: Caloric surplus + strenuous activity + high carry weight
	
	gain_modifier = (avg_daily_heavy_activity_kcal / 1000.0) + (avg_daily_carry_weight_kg)
	
	Hard cap: MUSCLE_CREATION_CAP_KCAL = 3500 kcal per day max muscle gain
	
	Logic:  Character must have surplus calories AND be performing heavy activity/carrying weight. 
	The surplus is converted to muscle up to the daily cap.
	Without activity stimulus, surplus goes to fat instead.

				MUSCLE LOSS
	Triggered by: Activity imbalance (sedentary > heavy) + moderate activity presence
	
	muscle_loss_factor = [avg_weekly_sedentary_minutes - avg_weekly_heavy_activity_minutes] × [avg_weekly_moderate_activity_minutes × 0.1]
	
	Logic: If character spends more time sedentary than doing heavy work, muscles atrophy.
	The presence of moderate activity slows atrophy (0.1 multiplier reduces loss).
	Pure sedentary (zero moderate activity) = maximum loss.
	Balanced or heavy-focused weeks = no loss or potential gain. 

				CALORIC CONVERSION
	Muscle mass stored as:  current_converted_value_ccv_kcal (3500 kcal = 1 kg muscle)
	Fat mass stored as: current_reserve_value_crv_kcal (7700 kcal = 1 kg fat)
	
	Deficit burn ratio: 3: 1 (Muscle: Fat) - muscles burned 3x faster than fat when in deficit

			DAILY vs WEEKLY PROCESSING
	Tick-level (short term: every hr): Handle immediate caloric balance (digestion vs burn)
	Daily: Calculate activity stimulus for muscle gain potential
	Weekly: Calculate activity pattern for muscle loss/atrophy

			Activity Thirst Rate -
	Resting In Heat - 2,541.67ml per hour-5.0 liters per hour in elite
	Average: Most people lose 0.5–2.0 liters per hour.
	Moderate Intensity: Roughly 1.0 liter (34 oz) per hour is common.
	High Intensity/Endurance: 1.5-2.0 liters per hour Rates can exceed 2,500 ml–3.0 liters per hour in elite

			Thirst-Lvls
	Mild Thirst (1%–2% Loss): This is the initial "thirst threshold".
	Strong Thirst (3%-4% Loss): Characterized by persistent, "very thirsty" feelings. Physical symptoms like dizziness, loss of appetite, and faintness often begin here.
	Extreme Thirst (5%–6% Loss): The urge to drink becomes overwhelming. This level is often accompanied by headaches, significant fatigue, and flushing of the skin.
	Severe Dehydration (10%+ Loss): thirst sensations may be overshadowed by life-threatening symptoms like delirium, seizures, and potential organ failure

			Thirst-Type
	Osmotic (Intracellular) Thirst: Triggered by ssalt and not enough water in your blood (e.g., after eating salty snacks).
	Hypovolemic (Extracellular) Thirst:  Triggered by a decrease in total blood volume

	The Satiety Signal: the brain "predicts" hydration and shuts off thirst signals within minutes of drinking. [Trigger signal to lower satiation Lvl on drinking before applying effects]

----- Illness System Factors & Formulas---------

## I. Pathogen Properties (Randomly Generated Base Stats)

These stats are inherent to the disease species and type.

*   **Property Name** | **Description** | **Type/Range**
*   :--- | :--- | :---
*   Type | Viral or Bacterial | Enum/String (e.g., 'Viral', 'Bacterial')
*   Species | Human, Animal, Plant | Enum/String
*   Transmission | Airborne, BloodBorne, Contact, Food/Waterborne | Tags (multiple possible)
*   ID50 (Infectious Dose) | The minimum load needed to establish infection (e.g., a count) | Integer
*   Infection Rate (beta) | How aggressively it spreads in a population (for World simulation) | Float (e.g., 0.1 to 0.5)
*   Duration (d) | How long a host is infectious (affects R0) | Time Unit (Turns/Hours/Days)
*   Target Body Parts | Primary limbs/organs affected (e.g., Lungs, Stomach, Legs) | List of Body Parts
*   Severity (Tier) | A multiplier for damage/fatigue accumulation rates | Float (e.g., 1x, 2x, 3x)

## II. Character Tracking Variables

These variables track the progression within an individual character.

*   **Variable Name** | **Description** | **Update Logic**
*   :--- | :--- | :---
*   Infection_Load | Current viral or bacterial count within the character | Increases during growth phase, decreases with immunity/treatment.
*   Infection_Stage | Incubation, Infectious, Symptomatic, Recovering | Based on elapsed time and Infection_Load.
*   Time_Exposed | Total turns since initial exposure | Increments every turn/hour.
*   Immunity_Level | Character's acquired resistance to this specific pathogen strain | Starts at 0, increases as they fight the infection.

## III. Formulas for Interaction with Existing Mechanics

The existing game stats (Constitution, Resilience, Toughness, Stamina) will modify the pathogen's effects.

### A. Infection Check (Initial Exposure)

When a character is exposed to the pathogen, roll a check against their defense stats compared to the pathogen's ID50.

*   Infection_Chance = (Pathogen_ID50_Threshold / (Constitution + Resilience)) * Exposure_Severity

### B. Disease Progression (Damage & Fatigue)

*   **Body Part Damage:**
    Damage_per_Turn = (Base_Pathogen_Severity * Infection_Load_Multiplier) / Target_Toughness

*   **Fatigue Accumulation:**
    New_Fatigue_Rate = Base_Fatigue_Rate * (1 + (Pathogen_Severity_Multiplier / Character_Stamina))

### C. Recovery

The character's immune system passively fights the infection using their stats, similar to the Drift mechanics.

*   Recovery_Rate = (Constitution + Resilience) * Immunity_Level * Heal_Modifier


-------Illness--------

# Formulas

## Load Required to Get Ill (Infectious Dose)

*   Median Infectious Dose (ID50) Spearman–Kärber Method:
    log ID50 = log(highest dilution giving 100% CPE) + 0.5 - (total number of test units showing CPE / number of test units per dilution)
*   Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) (Cell Culture):
    MOI = Number of viral particles used per well / Number of cells originally seeded in the well
*   Plaque Assay Titer:
    Titer (PFU/ml) = Plaques counted * (1 / dilution) * volume correction

CPE(Cytopathic Effect) - The observable damage or morphological changes a virus causes to host cells in a culture.

## Multiplier During Illness (Viral/Bacterial Growth)

*   Viral Load (from PCR Ct value):
    viral RNA copies per mL = 133.3333 * e^((37.933 - Ct) / 1.418)
*   Bacterial Growth Rate (k) (generations/unit time):
    k = log10(Nt / N0) / (0.301 * t)
*   Bacterial Number (exponential growth):
    Nt = N0 * 2^n
    or
    Nt = N t = N0 * 10^(Kt)
    or
    N t = N0 * e^(Kt)
    (Where n is the number of generations, and K is the growth rate constant.)

## Load Value for Passing It On (Transmission Threshold)

*   Basic Reproduction Number (R0) (from transmission rate beta and removal rate gamma):
    R0 = beta / gamma
    (Alternatively: R0 = tau * c_bar * d (transmissibility tau, average contact rate c_bar, duration of infectiousness d))
*   Basic Reproduction Number (from exponential growth rate r and generation time distribution g(tau)):
    R0_hat = 1 / Integral[g(tau) * exp(-r*tau) d(tau)]
*   Viral Dynamics Model (R0):
    R0 = lambda * beta * k / (dT * dI * c)
    (lambda = target cell production rate, beta = infection rate, k = virus production rate, dT = target cell death, dI = infected cell death, c = virus clearance rate.)

# Formulas and Definitions (Reproduction Rate)

## Basic Reproduction Number (R0)

R0 is a theoretical, dimensionless number representing the average number of new infections caused by one infected person in a completely susceptible population with no interventions in place.

*   **Formula 1:**
    R0 = tau * c_bar * d
    (tau = transmissibility; c_bar = average rate of contact; d = duration of infectiousness)
*   **Formula 2 (from SIR model):**
    R0 = beta / gamma
    (beta = transmission rate; gamma = removal rate, or 1/d)

## Effective Reproduction Number (Rt or Re)

Rt measures the actual transmission potential of a disease at a specific time t in a  population, considering existing immunity levels, vaccination coverage, and ongoing control measures.

*   **Formula:**
    Rt = R0 * S/N
    (S = number of susceptible individuals; N = total population size)

### Interpretation

*   If R0 or Rt > 1: disease continues to spread and grow.
*   If R0 or Rt < 1: disease spread slows down and eventually dies out.

# Illness Recovery Drift Formula

This formula calculates the amount of Infection_Load that the character's immune system eliminates during a given time period (e.g., per turn or per hour), using the character's existing stats.

*   **Infection_Load_Decrease** = MAX(1, (Current_Infection_Load / (Constitution + Resilience))) * (1 / (1 + (Time_Exposed / Recovery_Constant)))

### Variables

| Variable Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Infection_Load_Decrease`** | The amount to subtract from the Infection_Load each tick. |
| **`Current_Infection_Load`** | The current magnitude of the pathogen in the body. |
| **`Constitution`** | A core character stat (Willpower + Endurance). |
| **`Resilience`** | A core character stat (Willpower + Perception). |
| **`Time_Exposed`** | Total turns since initial exposure began. |
| **`Recovery_Constant`** | A high value (e.g., 9,000 turns) that governs the rate of recovery over time. |

I. NEW TRACKED VARIABLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
var tiredness:  float = 0.0           # 0-100 scale
var sleep_state: String = "Awake"    # Awake, Light, Deep, REM
var sleep_cycle_position: int = 0    # turns into current sleep cycle

================================================================================

II. TIREDNESS ACCUMULATION (CIRCADIAN SYSTEM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Base Accumulation Formula: 
   Tiredness_Gain_Per_Tick = (1 / 3000) × Activity_Modifier × Fatigue_Modifier

   Activity_Modifiers:
   - Sedentary:     ×0.75
   - Light:        ×1.0
   - Moderate:     ×1.25
   - Heavy:        ×1.5
   - Maximal:      ×2.0

   Fatigue_Modifier:
   - IF Fatigue > 50% Max_Stamina THEN ×2.0
   - ELSE ×1.0

B. Tiredness Threshold Effects: 

   | Tiredness % | State          | Effects                                              |
   |-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
   | 0-25%       | Alert          | No penalty                                           |
   | 26-50%      | Tired          | -10% Accuracy, -10% Aptitude                         |
   | 51-75%      | Exhausted      | -25% all mental stats, -15% physical stats, Yawning |
   | 76-90%      | Sleep-Deprived | -40% all stats, microsleep risk, hallucination chance|
   | 91-100%     | Collapse       | Forced unconsciousness, vulnerability state          |

   Microsleep Risk (76-90%):
   - Roll every 500 turns:  IF Random(100) < (Tiredness - 75) THEN blackout for 10-50 turns
   - During blackout: Cannot act, auto-fail perception checks, vulnerable

   Hallucination Chance (76-90%):
   - Roll every 1000 turns: IF Random(100) < (Tiredness - 70) THEN ESP takes 5 damage
   - Manifests as false sensory input (phantom sounds, movement in periphery)

================================================================================

III. SLEEP STATES & RESTORATION RATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Sleep State Multipliers: 

   | State        | Stamina Regen | Fatigue Decay    | Tiredness Decay  | HP Regen |
   |--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
   | Awake-Rest   | ×1.0 (base)   | -1 per 50 turns  | 0 (accumulates)  | ×1.0     |
   | Light Sleep  | ×2.0          | -2 per 50 turns  | -1 per 100 turns | ×1.5     |
   | Deep Sleep   | ×4.0          | -4 per 50 turns  | -3 per 100 turns | ×3.0     |
   | REM Sleep    | ×1.5          | -1 per 50 turns  | -2 per 100 turns | ×1.0     |

B. Full Sleep Cycle Structure (24000 turns = 8 hours):

   | Phase        | Turn Range      | Duration | Primary Function           |
   |--------------|-----------------|----------|----------------------------|
   | Light Sleep  | 0-3000          | 1 hour   | Transition in              |
   | Deep Sleep   | 3000-15000      | 4 hours  | Physical restoration       |
   | REM Sleep    | 15000-21000     | 2 hours  | Psyche/mental restoration  |
   | Light Sleep  | 21000-24000     | 1 hour   | Transition out             |

   Cycle Completion Bonus:
   - Full cycle completed:  Tiredness = 0, +5 Courage, +5 Confidence
   - Partial cycle (>50%): Tiredness = 25%, no morale bonus
   - Partial cycle (<50%): Tiredness = 50%, -5 Courage, -5 Confidence

================================================================================

IV.  SLEEP INTERRUPTION & GROGGINESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.  Interruption Effects by Phase:

   | Interrupted During | Grogginess % | Stat Penalty | Duration (turns) |
   |--------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
   | Light Sleep        | 25%          | -10% all     | 300 (6 min)      |
   | Deep Sleep         | 50%          | -20% all     | 900 (18 min)     |
   | REM Sleep          | 35%          | -15% all     | 600 (12 min)     |

B. REM Interruption Special Damage:
   ESP_Damage = Tiredness_At_Sleep_Start / 10
   Random_Sense += 15 Hyperstimulation
   Rationale -= 10 (shifts toward negative/irritability)

C. Grogginess Decay:
   Grogginess_Per_Tick = -Grogginess / Grogginess_Duration
   (Linear decay over duration)

================================================================================

V.  DREAM STATES & PSYCHE EFFECTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Dream Type Determination (rolled at REM phase entry):

   Base Roll = Random(100)

   | Condition                                      | Dream Type   | Roll Range |
   |------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|
   | Active curse OR failed cultivation attempt     | Demonic      | Auto       |
   | Morale (Courage + Confidence) < -50            | Nightmare    | 0-60       |
   | Morale (Courage + Confidence) < -50            | Neutral      | 61-100     |
   | Morale between -50 and +50                     | Neutral      | 0-70       |
   | Morale between -50 and +50                     | Memory       | 71-85      |
   | Morale between -50 and +50                     | Pleasant     | 86-100     |
   | Morale > +50                                   | Pleasant     | 0-60       |
   | Morale > +50                                   | Prophetic*   | 61-75      |
   | Morale > +50                                   | Memory       | 76-100     |

   *Prophetic requires:  ESP > 75% max AND Arcane skill > 50

B. Dream Effects Table:

   | Dream Type | Rationale Effect | ESP Effect      | Morale Effect        | Special                    |
   |------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
   | Neutral    | Drift toward 0   | +5 recovery     | None                 | None                       |
   | Pleasant   | +5 toward pos.    | +10 recovery    | +10 Courage, +5 Conf | None                       |
   | Nightmare  | -10 toward neg.  | -5 (damage)     | -15 Courage, -10 Conf| Wake check each 1000 turns |
   | Prophetic  | No change        | +15 recovery    | +5 Confidence        | UEG event preview generated|
   | Demonic    | See combat below | See combat      | -20 both             | Must resolve dream combat  |
   | Memory     | +5 toward pos.   | No change       | +5 Confidence        | +5% Muscle Memory to skill*|

   *Memory Replay:  Applies to highest-trained skill from previous wake period

C. Demonic Intrusion Resolution: 

   Dream_Attack_Value = Event_Severity × (100 - Resilience) / 100
   ESP_Damage = Dream_Attack_Value - (Constitution / 10)
   
   IF ESP_Damage > Current_ESP THEN: 
       Forced_Wake = TRUE
       sleep_state = "Awake"
       Apply Terrified_State (Courage = -100 for 500 turns)
       Tiredness += 25
   ELSE:
       ESP -= ESP_Damage
       Continue REM phase
       On wake: -10 Courage, -10 Confidence, memory of threat

D.  Nightmare Wake Check:
   Every 1000 turns during Nightmare: 
   IF Random(100) < (50 - Resilience/2) THEN:
       Forced_Wake = TRUE
       Apply REM Interruption penalties
       Tiredness += 15

================================================================================

VI. SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.  Metabolism Integration:
   - Sleep activity level = Sedentary (BMR ×1.0)
   - Digestion rate = 50% of normal during all sleep states
   - Caloric burn continues at sedentary rate
   - Thirst accumulation = 50% of normal rate

B. Combat Integration:
   - Cannot initiate combat while asleep
   - IF attacked while asleep: 
       - Attacker gets auto-hit on first strike
       - Defender wakes in Surprised state (cannot act for 1 turn)
       - Apply interruption grogginess based on current sleep phase
   - Sleeping = +50% to enemy hit chance until fully awake

C. Magic Integration:
   - Continuous spells drain VP during sleep at normal rate
   - Meditation can substitute for Light Sleep (not Deep/REM)
   - Cultivation breakthrough attempts require:  Tiredness < 25%
   - Some rituals require sleep-state entry (Prophetic dream triggers)

D. Social Integration:
   - Sleeping in public = vulnerability flag for theft/assassination AI
   - Sleeping near allies (same tile/adjacent): +10 Morale on wake
   - Sleeping in hostile territory:  Nightmare chance +20%
   - Witnessed sleeping = potential ambush event generation

E. Illness Integration:
   - Deep Sleep: Immunity effectiveness +25%
   - Infection_Load_Decrease ×1.5 during Deep Sleep
   - IF sick:  Tiredness accumulation ×1.5 while awake
   - Fever state: Cannot enter Deep Sleep (Light/REM only)

F. Morale Integration:
   - Full rest cycle:  +5 Courage, +5 Confidence
   - Interrupted cycle: -10 Courage, -10 Confidence
   - Sleep deprivation (>75% Tiredness): Morale decay -1 per 500 turns
   - Pleasant dream: +10 Courage, +5 Confidence
   - Nightmare: -15 Courage, -10 Confidence

================================================================================

VII. LOCATION & COMFORT MODIFIERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Surface Comfort Levels:

   | Surface Type       | Comfort Level | Sleep Quality Modifier |
   |--------------------|---------------|------------------------|
   | Stone/Hard Ground  | 0             | ×0.5 all restoration   |
   | Dirt/Grass         | 1             | ×0.75 all restoration  |
   | Bedroll/Mat        | 2             | ×1.0 (base)            |
   | Straw Bed          | 3             | ×1.15 all restoration  |
   | Mattress           | 4             | ×1.25 all restoration  |
   | Quality Bed        | 5             | ×1.5 all restoration   |

B. Environmental Modifiers:

   | Condition              | Effect                                    |
   |------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
   | Sheltered (indoors)    | +10% restoration rates                    |
   | Temperature comfortable| No modifier                               |
   | Too hot (>30°C)        | -20% Deep Sleep time, +Tiredness on wake  |
   | Too cold (<10°C)       | -30% all restoration, wake checks         |
   | Noisy environment      | -25% REM time, Memory dream impossible    |
   | Unsafe location        | Cannot enter Deep Sleep, Light/REM only   |
   | Sacred/blessed ground  | Demonic dream impossible, +20% ESP recovery|

C. Combined Formula: 
   Effective_Restoration = Base_Rate × Comfort_Modifier × Environment_Modifier

================================================================================

VIII. SPECIAL CASES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Forced Sleep (non-Tiredness sources):
   - Sleep spells:  Bypass Tiredness, enter Light Sleep directly
   - Poison (sedative): Tiredness +50 immediate, drowsy state
   - Knockout (combat): Unconscious state (not sleep, no restoration)
   - Alcohol/drugs: Modified sleep (no REM, Deep Sleep only)

B. Cultivator Sleep Modifications:
   | Cultivation Stage    | Tiredness Accumulation | Sleep Requirement |
   |----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
   | Mortal               | ×1.0                   | Full cycle needed |
   | Qi Condensation      | ×0.95                  | Full cycle needed |
   | Foundation Est.      | ×0.85                  | 75% cycle sufficient|
   | Golden Core          | ×0.70                  | 50% cycle sufficient|
   | Nascent Soul         | ×0.50                  | 25% cycle sufficient|
   | Spirit Transformation| ×0.25                  | Meditation substitutes|
   | Void Refinement+     | ×0.10                  | Sleep optional     |

   Meditation Substitution (Spirit Transformation+):
   - 1 hour meditation = 2 hours Light Sleep equivalent
   - Cannot substitute Deep Sleep restoration
   - Psyche restoration requires actual REM or special cultivation techniques

C. Party Sleep Logic:
   - When PC initiates sleep: Prompt for party behavior
   - Options: 
       1. "All Sleep" - Party sleeps simultaneously (ambush vulnerable)
       2. "Set Watch" - Select companions for watch rotation
       3. "I'll Sleep Alone" - Companions remain awake (their Tiredness accumulates)
   
   Watch Rotation: 
   - Watcher cannot restore Tiredness
   - Watcher Perception checks every 500 turns for threats
   - IF threat detected: Watcher wakes party (reduced grogginess, -50%)
   - Watch shifts:  Auto-rotate every 8000 turns (configurable)

================================================================================

IX.  FORMULAS SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tiredness_Accumulation: 
    ΔTiredness = (1/3000) × Activity_Mod × Fatigue_Mod × Cultivation_Mod

Restoration_Rate:
    Effective_Rate = Base_Rate × Sleep_State_Mult × Comfort_Mod × Environment_Mod

Grogginess_Application:
    Current_Stat = Base_Stat × (1 - Grogginess/100)
    Grogginess_Decay = Grogginess / Grogginess_Duration per turn

Dream_Attack_Resolution:
    Dream_Attack = Event_Severity × (100 - Resilience) / 100
    ESP_Damage = MAX(0, Dream_Attack - Constitution/10)

Sleep_Quality_Score:
    Quality = (Deep_Sleep_Time/12000 × 0.5) + (REM_Time/6000 × 0.3) + (Comfort × 0.2)
    IF Quality > 0.8 THEN Full_Rest_Bonus applies

Macronutrient Absorption Rates [Digestion]

Carbohydrates (single source): Approximately 60 grams per hour (~240 kcal/hr) using a single transport mechanism (e.g., glucose only).
Carbohydrates (multiple sources): Up to 90-105 grams per hour (~360-420 kcal/hr) when combining multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., a glucose and fructose mixture at a 2:1 ratio).
Protein: The rate is highly dependent on the type of protein:
Fast-digesting protein [Lean protien](e.g., whey): Roughly 8-10 grams per hour (~32-40 kcal/hr).
Slow-digesting protein [Fatty protien](e.g., cooked egg): About 3 grams per hour (~12 kcal/hr).
Fat: Fat absorption is complex and generally slower than carbohydrate or protein absorption per hour during exercise, and it slows gastric emptying. While fat provides 9 kcal per gram, a high-fat meal takes much longer to process overall. 
The body is highly efficient at absorbing nearly all fat consumed over the full digestive cycle, but the hourly rate during physical exertion is lower than for simple carbs. *Base starting value About 1 gram per hour (~9 kcal/hr)
   

FORMULAS***
								Task Completion Time Calculation - " calculate - Skill effect on task"		

% 1. TOTAL OBSERVED TIME (The Raw Baseline)
T_{obs} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i

% 2. NORMAL TIME (Adjusting for Subject Skill/Performance)
T_n = T_{obs} \times \left( \frac{R}{100} \right)

% 3. STANDARD TIME (The Final Practical Estimate)
T_s = T_n \times (1 + A)

% WHERE:
% s_i = Time per individual step
% n   = Total number of steps (Task Complexity)

% R   = Performance Rating / Skill Factor (e.g., 100 = Standard)
% A   = Allowance Factor for fatigue/delays (e.g., 0.15 = 15%)



[Formula explanation: -The Estimation Formula The total estimated time is the sum of individual step durations, modified by a skill-based performance factor: 
			 	(T= [sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}] x [{1}{S})\(s_{i})-> (1\S)] 
				(Individual Step-Times): The average time estimated for each discrete step in the task.
				(n) (Task Complexity): The total number of steps in the sequence.
				(S) (Subject Skill): A rating factor where 1.0 represents the "standard" or average skill level.

 			- Refining Your Estimate To account for uncertainty or "minimum average time" (the best-case scenario), use these industry-standard methods: 
				Three-Point Estimation (PERT): Combine your best-case (optimistic), worst-case (pessimistic), and most-likely times to find a realistic average:
				(Estimate)= [O+4M+P]\6) 
				(O) is the optimistic (min) time, (M) is the most likely, and (P) is the pessimistic.

			- Normal Time Calculation: Professionals often use a Time Study Rating Factor to convert observed average time into "Normal Time" by multiplying the average time by a performance rating (Skill).
				Time Study Rating Factor (or Performance Rating) is used to normalize the time a specific person took to perform a task compared to the time a "standard" worker would take. 
				The Rating Factor Formula The rating factor is typically expressed as a percentage, where 100% represents a "normal" or standard pace. 
				[Rating Factor]= [Observed Performance]\[Standard Performance] x 100) 
				Rating > 100: The subject is working faster than the standard pace.Rating < 100: 
				The subject is working slower than the standard pace. 

			- Applying the Rating to Task Time To find the Normal Time 
				(NT)— the time an average worker would require—you multiply the average time you actually observed (OT) by the rating factor: 
				(NT= [Average Observed Time] x ([Rating Factor]\100]

			-	To calculate the final Standard Time (Ts), we combine the complexity of the task, the subject's skill (performance rating), and an allowance factor for human fatigue or unavoidable delays. 
				
				1: Calculate Total Observed Time Sum the individual times recorded for each step in the task sequence to find the total time actually taken by the subject. 
					(T(obs)=[sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}]

				2: Determine Normal Time Adjust the observed time based on the Rating Factor (R). This accounts for the subject's skill and effort relative to a standard 100% pace.
					(T(n) = T(obs) x [R\100]

				3: Apply Allowances for Standard Time To reach a realistic time that can be sustained over a workday, apply an Allowance Factor (\(A\)). This typically ranges from 10% to 20% to account for personal needs, fatigue, and minor interruptions. 
					(T(s) = T(n) x (1+A)

                 		The final formula to determine the subject's time to complete a task is:
					(T(s) = T(obs) x [R\100] x [1+A]
				Where: T(obs) is the sum of individual step-times.
					R is the Performance Rating 
					A is the Allowance Factor expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).
