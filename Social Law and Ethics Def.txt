Currency

1. Establish the Baseline Value
You already have the core baseline for your economy:
1 sila silver = 0.73 kg grain
This sets the purchasing power of silver in terms of the most essential commodity (food).
2. Determine Metal-to-Metal Ratios
Historically, the value ratios between precious metals were relatively stable but set by ruling authorities or market forces. The most common historical ratios were around 12:1 to 15:1 for gold to silver and approximately 40:1 to 50:1 for silver to copper by weight. 
For this example, we will use the Roman system's approximate ratios under Augustus: 
1 gram of gold ≈ 12 grams of silver
1 gram of silver ≈ 41 grams of copper 
3. Calculate Equivalent Values in Grain
Using the ratios and your baseline, you can now determine the grain value for all metals:
Silver: 1 gram silver ≈ 0.73 kg grain / (weight of 1 sila silver). If we assume a sila is a weight of, say, 11g (similar to a historical shekel), then 1 gram of silver ≈ 0.066 kg of grain.
Gold: Since 1g gold ≈ 12g silver, 1 gram of gold ≈ 12 × (0.066 kg grain) ≈ 0.79 kg grain.
Copper: Since 1g silver ≈ 41g copper, 1 gram of copper ≈ 0.066 kg grain / 41 ≈ 0.0016 kg grain. 
4. Determine Prices for Other Goods
The value of all other goods will be determined by their supply and demand relative to grain and metals in your specific market:
Labor: A day's worth of common labor might be valued at a certain amount of grain (e.g., 2 kg of grain) or its silver equivalent.
Manufactured Goods: The price of a tool would reflect the cost of the raw copper, plus the labor required to make it.
Luxury Items: Items like spices, fine cloth, or exotic materials would have prices driven by scarcity and desirability, expressed in silver or gold weight

func get_item_market_value(item, market_context):
    # Baseline: calculate weight in silver/grain equivalent
    base_value = item.weight * silver_value_per_gram * grain_value_per_silver
    # Apply all quality, condition, rarity modifiers (from item.modifiers)
    value_mod = ModifierSystem.get_total_value_modifier(item.modifiers)
    # Scarcity/demand: context from trade logs
    scarcity_mod = market_context.get_scarcity_mod(item.type)
    # Self-correction: average over all recent transaction values for this item
    # Final calculation
    true_value = base_value * value_mod * scarcity_mod
    return round(true_value, 2)
