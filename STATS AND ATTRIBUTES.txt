		     6. Temperature	 Radiation/Heat [Though temperature is exprienced through touch, this will be split cognitetavily for Psyche-calcs]
		     7. ESP		 [All other Senses][Emotional State = Logos, Pathos, Ethos] Represents the sense of imagine/percieve reality and the mental link between the two (The ability of the mind to influence imagined/perceived reality)
							    [as Stat* Ability to make predictions or instinctual decisions/auto-regulation - Governs info output/& cast fail chance]
		For short-hand design mental attack will use Pysche targeting in the same way physical attacks use bodypart targeting [Since touch is a physical sense it will target a bodypart but will damage the sense]
		Psyche-Damage - Senses cannot be mentally destroyed and therefore wont lose or gain health. Rather each sense has a Tolerance level that functions as health. When Stimulated the current Tolerance is raised,
				If max tolerance is exceeded that sense is over\rwhelemed and becomes unreliable. When Deprived the current Tolerance is decreased, if min Tolerance is exceeded that sense is dimmed or disabled.

Macronutrient Absorption Rates [Digestion]

Carbohydrates (single source): Approximately 60 grams per hour (~240 kcal/hr) using a single transport mechanism (e.g., glucose only).
Carbohydrates (multiple sources): Up to 90-105 grams per hour (~360-420 kcal/hr) when combining multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., a glucose and fructose mixture at a 2:1 ratio).
Protein: The rate is highly dependent on the type of protein:
Fast-digesting protein [Lean protien](e.g., whey): Roughly 8-10 grams per hour (~32-40 kcal/hr).
Slow-digesting protein [Fatty protien](e.g., cooked egg): About 3 grams per hour (~12 kcal/hr).
Fat: Fat absorption is complex and generally slower than carbohydrate or protein absorption per hour during exercise, and it slows gastric emptying. While fat provides 9 kcal per gram, a high-fat meal takes much longer to process overall. 
The body is highly efficient at absorbing nearly all fat consumed over the full digestive cycle, but the hourly rate during physical exertion is lower than for simple carbs. *Base starting value About 1 gram per hour (~9 kcal/hr)
   

FORMULAS***
								Task Completion Time Calculation - " calculate - Skill effect on task"		

% 1. TOTAL OBSERVED TIME (The Raw Baseline)
T_{obs} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i

% 2. NORMAL TIME (Adjusting for Subject Skill/Performance)
T_n = T_{obs} \times \left( \frac{R}{100} \right)

% 3. STANDARD TIME (The Final Practical Estimate)
T_s = T_n \times (1 + A)

% WHERE:
% s_i = Time per individual step
% n   = Total number of steps (Task Complexity)

% R   = Performance Rating / Skill Factor (e.g., 100 = Standard)
% A   = Allowance Factor for fatigue/delays (e.g., 0.15 = 15%)






[Formula explanation: -The Estimation Formula The total estimated time is the sum of individual step durations, modified by a skill-based performance factor: 
			 	(T= [sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}] x [{1}{S})\(s_{i})-> (1\S)] 
				(Individual Step-Times): The average time estimated for each discrete step in the task.
				(n) (Task Complexity): The total number of steps in the sequence.
				(S) (Subject Skill): A rating factor where 1.0 represents the "standard" or average skill level.

 			- Refining Your Estimate To account for uncertainty or "minimum average time" (the best-case scenario), use these industry-standard methods: 
				Three-Point Estimation (PERT): Combine your best-case (optimistic), worst-case (pessimistic), and most-likely times to find a realistic average:
				(Estimate)= [O+4M+P]\6) 
				(O) is the optimistic (min) time, (M) is the most likely, and (P) is the pessimistic.

			- Normal Time Calculation: Professionals often use a Time Study Rating Factor to convert observed average time into "Normal Time" by multiplying the average time by a performance rating (Skill).
				Time Study Rating Factor (or Performance Rating) is used to normalize the time a specific person took to perform a task compared to the time a "standard" worker would take. 
				The Rating Factor Formula The rating factor is typically expressed as a percentage, where 100% represents a "normal" or standard pace. 
				[Rating Factor]= [Observed Performance]\[Standard Performance] x 100) 
				Rating > 100: The subject is working faster than the standard pace.Rating < 100: 
				The subject is working slower than the standard pace. 

			- Applying the Rating to Task Time To find the Normal Time 
				(NT)— the time an average worker would require—you multiply the average time you actually observed (OT) by the rating factor: 
				(NT= [Average Observed Time] x ([Rating Factor]\100]

			-	To calculate the final Standard Time (Ts), we combine the complexity of the task, the subject's skill (performance rating), and an allowance factor for human fatigue or unavoidable delays. 
				
				1: Calculate Total Observed Time Sum the individual times recorded for each step in the task sequence to find the total time actually taken by the subject. 
					(T(obs)=[sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}]

				2: Determine Normal Time Adjust the observed time based on the Rating Factor (R). This accounts for the subject's skill and effort relative to a standard 100% pace.
					(T(n) = T(obs) x [R\100]

				3: Apply Allowances for Standard Time To reach a realistic time that can be sustained over a workday, apply an Allowance Factor (\(A\)). This typically ranges from 10% to 20% to account for personal needs, fatigue, and minor interruptions. 
					(T(s) = T(n) x (1+A)

                 		The final formula to determine the subject's time to complete a task is:
					(T(s) = T(obs) x [R\100] x [1+A]
				Where: T(obs) is the sum of individual step-times.
					R is the Performance Rating 
					A is the Allowance Factor expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).
