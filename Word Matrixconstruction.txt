	"1. Nouns: Number and Ownership
Nouns use inflectional suffixes to indicate quantity and possession. Khan Academy
Pluralization: Most nouns add -s or -es (e.g., dog → dogs, wish → wishes). Scribendi
Possession: Singular nouns add -’s (kitten’s), while plural nouns typically add only an apostrophe if they already end in ""s"" (kittens’). QuillBot
2. Verbs: Tense and Agreement
Verbs undergo constant morphological change through inflectional endings to match the subject and time. Sarah's Teaching Snippets
Third-Person Singular: Adding -s or -es to indicate present tense (e.g., I go → He goes). Wikipedia
Past Tense: Adding -ed or -d for regular verbs (e.g., walk → walked). YouTube: Introduction to Morphology
Present Participle: Adding -ing to indicate ongoing action (paint → repainting). YouTube: Introduction to Morphology
3. Adjectives: Intensity (Comparison)
Adjectives use suffixes to show degrees of comparison. Grammarly
Comparative: Adding -er to compare two things (e.g., fast → faster). EF United States
Superlative: Adding -est to indicate the highest degree in a group (e.g., fast → fastest). Albert.io
Spelling Shifts: If an adjective ends in -y, it changes to -i before the suffix (happy → happier). Lingo Apps
"				Action-Type Manual: 						
	"4. Derivational Morphology (Changing Word Class)
This process creates entirely new parts of speech by adding specific suffixes to a ""root"" or ""base"" word. Penn Linguistics
Verb to Noun: Adding -er (agent) or -ance (abstract) (e.g., write → writer, deliver → deliverance). Wikipedia
Adjective to Verb: Adding -en or -ize (e.g., weak → weaken, final → finalize). Penn Linguistics
Noun to Adjective: Adding -al, -ous, or -less (e.g., recreation → recreational, symptom → symptomless). Scribd
Adverb Morphology (The Suffix Specialists)
5.Adverbs are almost always formed by adding a suffix to a base word (usually an adjective). Wordy
Derivational Suffixes:
-ly: The most common way to turn an adjective into an adverb (e.g., quick → quickly, quiet → quietly). GINGER
-wise: Added to nouns to show direction or manner (e.g., clockwise, lengthwise, otherwise). Scribd
-ward(s): Added to indicate direction (e.g., backward, homeward, upwards). Scribd
Spelling Rules for ""-ly"":
If the base ends in -y, it changes to -i (e.g., happy → happily). My English Class
If it ends in -le, drop the -e and add -y (e.g., gentle → gently). My English Class
If it ends in -ic, add -ally (e.g., tragic → tragically). My English Class
6.Preposition Morphology (The Compounders)
Unlike adverbs, prepositions rarely use consistent suffixes. They are formed through compounding or functional derivation. Scribd
Compound Prepositions: Combining two or more morphemes into a single word. Scribd
In + to → Into
With + in → Within
Out + side → Outside
Participial Prepositions: Verbs modified with an -ing or -ed suffix that have evolved to function as prepositions. Scribd
Considering (e.g., ""Considering the weather..."")
Concerning (e.g., ""Questions concerning the law..."")
Provided (e.g., ""Provided that you stay..."")
A-Prefixing: An ancient way of forming prepositions from nouns or verbs (e.g., Board → Aboard, Float → Afloat, Cross → Across). Scribd"				Build,
