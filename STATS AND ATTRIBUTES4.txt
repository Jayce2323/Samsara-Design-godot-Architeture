	[Sense & Rationale Tracking - e.states "hp" starts at 0, + attack raise hp, - attacks lower hp. Applies to both speech and mental attacks.}		

	ESP & Sense- Esp Represents the sense of imagine/percieve reality and the mental link between the two (The ability of the mind to influence imagined/perceived reality).
			Senses 1-6 - Follow Rationale logic for damage and simulation. Sense 7 [ESP] - is the only sense with proper "hp" score. "Attacks" + or -.
			Mental Attack calc = Spell effect dmg - Enemy-Resilience = Pen check-> Pen-check - ESP = Mental dmg taken [MDT] -> MDT x 10 = Damage to targeted Sense
			Speech combat does not effect ESP or Sense.
    
		For short-hand design mental attack will use Pysche targeting in the same way physical attacks use bodypart targeting [Since touch is a physical sense it will target a bodypart but will damage the sense]
		Psyche-Damage - Senses cannot be mentally destroyed and therefore wont lose or gain health. Rather each sense has a Tolerance level that functions as health. When Stimulated the current Tolerance is raised,
				If max tolerance is exceeded that sense is overrwhelemed and becomes unreliable. When Deprived the current Tolerance is decreased, if min Tolerance is exceeded that sense is dimmed or disabled.


			 [Fatigue = intensity and duration of anaerobic effort. if Fatigue = Max Stamina character has 100% chance to become immobile/comatose.
					Fatigue Accumulation (HR‑Linked): Fatigue increases faster when HR exceeds the character’s Aerobic Threshold (75% MHR) and accelerates sharply past Anaerobic Threshold (85–90% MHR).
					Each 10% of max stamina burned still generates 1 fatigue point, but HR zone modifies the rate:
																	Zone 1–2 (<75% MHR): No modifier
																	Zone 3 (75–85% MHR): +25% fatigue rate
																	Zone 4 (85–90% MHR): +50% fatigue rate
																	Zone 5 (>90% MHR): +100% fatigue rate

											*Muscle Gain & Loss System*

				MUSCLE GAIN
	Triggered by: Caloric surplus + strenuous activity + high carry weight
	
	gain_modifier = (avg_daily_heavy_activity_kcal / 1000.0) + (avg_daily_carry_weight_kg / carry_capacity)
	
	Hard cap: MUSCLE_CREATION_CAP_KCAL = 3500 kcal per day max muscle gain
	
	Logic:  Character must have surplus calories AND be performing heavy activity/carrying weight. 
	The surplus is converted to muscle up to the daily cap.
	Without activity stimulus, surplus goes to fat instead.

				MUSCLE LOSS
	Triggered by: Activity imbalance (sedentary > heavy) + moderate activity presence
	
	muscle_loss_factor = [avg_weekly_sedentary_minutes - avg_weekly_heavy_activity_minutes] × [avg_weekly_moderate_activity_minutes × 0.1]
	
	Logic: If character spends more time sedentary than doing heavy work, muscles atrophy.
	The presence of moderate activity slows atrophy (0.1 multiplier reduces loss).
	Pure sedentary (zero moderate activity) = maximum loss.
	Balanced or heavy-focused weeks = no loss or potential gain. 

				CALORIC CONVERSION
	Muscle mass stored as:  current_converted_value_ccv_kcal (3500 kcal = 1 kg muscle)
	Fat mass stored as: current_reserve_value_crv_kcal (7700 kcal = 1 kg fat)
	
	Deficit burn ratio: 3: 1 (Muscle: Fat) - muscles burned 3x faster than fat when in deficit

			DAILY vs WEEKLY PROCESSING
	Tick-level (short term: every hr): Handle immediate caloric balance (digestion vs burn)
	Daily: Calculate activity stimulus for muscle gain potential
	Weekly: Calculate activity pattern for muscle loss/atrophy

			Activity Thirst Rate -
	Resting In Heat - 2,541.67ml per hour-5.0 liters per hour in elite
	Average: Most people lose 0.5–2.0 liters per hour.
	Moderate Intensity: Roughly 1.0 liter (34 oz) per hour is common.
	High Intensity/Endurance: 1.5-2.0 liters per hour Rates can exceed 2,500 ml–3.0 liters per hour in elite

			Thirst-Lvls
	Mild Thirst (1%–2% Loss): This is the initial "thirst threshold".
	Strong Thirst (3%-4% Loss): Characterized by persistent, "very thirsty" feelings. Physical symptoms like dizziness, loss of appetite, and faintness often begin here.
	Extreme Thirst (5%–6% Loss): The urge to drink becomes overwhelming. This level is often accompanied by headaches, significant fatigue, and flushing of the skin.
	Severe Dehydration (10%+ Loss): thirst sensations may be overshadowed by life-threatening symptoms like delirium, seizures, and potential organ failure

			Thirst-Type

Macronutrient Absorption Rates [Digestion]

Carbohydrates (single source): Approximately 60 grams per hour (~240 kcal/hr) using a single transport mechanism (e.g., glucose only).
Carbohydrates (multiple sources): Up to 90-105 grams per hour (~360-420 kcal/hr) when combining multiple transportable carbohydrates (e.g., a glucose and fructose mixture at a 2:1 ratio).
Protein: The rate is highly dependent on the type of protein:
Fast-digesting protein [Lean protien](e.g., whey): Roughly 8-10 grams per hour (~32-40 kcal/hr).
Slow-digesting protein [Fatty protien](e.g., cooked egg): About 3 grams per hour (~12 kcal/hr).
Fat: Fat absorption is complex and generally slower than carbohydrate or protein absorption per hour during exercise, and it slows gastric emptying. While fat provides 9 kcal per gram, a high-fat meal takes much longer to process overall. 
The body is highly efficient at absorbing nearly all fat consumed over the full digestive cycle, but the hourly rate during physical exertion is lower than for simple carbs. *Base starting value About 1 gram per hour (~9 kcal/hr)
   

FORMULAS***
								Task Completion Time Calculation - " calculate - Skill effect on task"		

% 1. TOTAL OBSERVED TIME (The Raw Baseline)
T_{obs} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i

% 2. NORMAL TIME (Adjusting for Subject Skill/Performance)
T_n = T_{obs} \times \left( \frac{R}{100} \right)

% 3. STANDARD TIME (The Final Practical Estimate)
T_s = T_n \times (1 + A)

% WHERE:
% s_i = Time per individual step
% n   = Total number of steps (Task Complexity)

% R   = Performance Rating / Skill Factor (e.g., 100 = Standard)
% A   = Allowance Factor for fatigue/delays (e.g., 0.15 = 15%)



[Formula explanation: -The Estimation Formula The total estimated time is the sum of individual step durations, modified by a skill-based performance factor: 
			 	(T= [sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}] x [{1}{S})\(s_{i})-> (1\S)] 
				(Individual Step-Times): The average time estimated for each discrete step in the task.
				(n) (Task Complexity): The total number of steps in the sequence.
				(S) (Subject Skill): A rating factor where 1.0 represents the "standard" or average skill level.

 			- Refining Your Estimate To account for uncertainty or "minimum average time" (the best-case scenario), use these industry-standard methods: 
				Three-Point Estimation (PERT): Combine your best-case (optimistic), worst-case (pessimistic), and most-likely times to find a realistic average:
				(Estimate)= [O+4M+P]\6) 
				(O) is the optimistic (min) time, (M) is the most likely, and (P) is the pessimistic.

			- Normal Time Calculation: Professionals often use a Time Study Rating Factor to convert observed average time into "Normal Time" by multiplying the average time by a performance rating (Skill).
				Time Study Rating Factor (or Performance Rating) is used to normalize the time a specific person took to perform a task compared to the time a "standard" worker would take. 
				The Rating Factor Formula The rating factor is typically expressed as a percentage, where 100% represents a "normal" or standard pace. 
				[Rating Factor]= [Observed Performance]\[Standard Performance] x 100) 
				Rating > 100: The subject is working faster than the standard pace.Rating < 100: 
				The subject is working slower than the standard pace. 

			- Applying the Rating to Task Time To find the Normal Time 
				(NT)— the time an average worker would require—you multiply the average time you actually observed (OT) by the rating factor: 
				(NT= [Average Observed Time] x ([Rating Factor]\100]

			-	To calculate the final Standard Time (Ts), we combine the complexity of the task, the subject's skill (performance rating), and an allowance factor for human fatigue or unavoidable delays. 
				
				1: Calculate Total Observed Time Sum the individual times recorded for each step in the task sequence to find the total time actually taken by the subject. 
					(T(obs)=[sum {i=1}^{n}s_{i}]

				2: Determine Normal Time Adjust the observed time based on the Rating Factor (R). This accounts for the subject's skill and effort relative to a standard 100% pace.
					(T(n) = T(obs) x [R\100]

				3: Apply Allowances for Standard Time To reach a realistic time that can be sustained over a workday, apply an Allowance Factor (\(A\)). This typically ranges from 10% to 20% to account for personal needs, fatigue, and minor interruptions. 
					(T(s) = T(n) x (1+A)

                 		The final formula to determine the subject's time to complete a task is:
					(T(s) = T(obs) x [R\100] x [1+A]
				Where: T(obs) is the sum of individual step-times.
					R is the Performance Rating 
					A is the Allowance Factor expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%).
