-----------------------------Social-Formulas-----------------------------------------------------------------

The basic conceptual formula for the expected number of people you might encounter in a given range is: 
(E= D (x)A) 
Where: (E): Expected number of people encountered.
(D): Population density (people per unit of area, e.g., people per square mile).
(A): The area covered by your search "range" (typically \(\pi r^{2}\) for a circular radius \(r\)). 

Calculating the Probability of Meeting at Least One Person To find the actual probability ((P)) of meeting at least one person, 
assuming people are distributed randomly (often modeled using a Poisson distribution), the formula is: 
             λᵏ * e⁻ᶝ
P(X = k) = —————————————
                  k!
(P(X=k)\): The probability of (k) events occurring.
 (Lambda): The average number of events in the given interval (calculated as Density × Area).
(e): Euler's number (approximately 2.71828).
(k): The actual number of occurrences you are testing for (e.g., meeting exactly 1 person, 2 people, etc.).
(k!): The factorial of \(k\). This represents the probability of not finding zero people in the specified area.


Simplified Ratio Method If you are looking for the probability of meeting one specific person out of a total population ((N)) within a lifetime or specific timeframe, the basic ratio is: 
P=Interactions\Total-Population




Chaos factor Note- Formula:

The most common ways to represent the Chaos Factor mathematically are through Lyapunov Exponents (to measure sensitivity) and Logistic Maps (to measure population-driven instability). 

1. The Sensitivity Formula (Lyapunov Exponent) This formula calculates how quickly a small change at the Micro level (e.g., a family dispute) can spiral into a Macro level crisis (e.g., social unrest). 
. 		THE SENSITIVITY FORMULA (Micro-Level Drift): λ = lim (t→∞) [ (1/t) * ln |d(t) / d(0)| ]
   		(Measures how fast a small Micro change spirals into a Macro event)
		(Lambda): The Chaos Factor.\(d(0)\): Initial distance between two social states.
		(d(t)\): The distance between those states over time.Interpretation: If \(\lambda \) is positive, the system is chaotic. Even a tiny "Micro" change will eventually disrupt the entire "Macro" state. 

2. The Feedback Formula (Logistic Map) Used to predict when a Meso-level group (like a Clan or Religion) will become unstable due to resource competition or over-population. 
		THE FEEDBACK FORMULA (Meso-Level Instability)
   		X_next = r * X_current * (1 - X_current)
   		(Measures when Clan/Religious growth triggers systemic collapse)

		(x_{n}\): The current state of the system (between 0 and 1).
		(r\): The "growth rate" or Chaos Parameter.
Breakdown of \(r\):\(r<3.0\): The system is Stable. Families and Clans are in equilibrium.
(3.0<r<3.5\): The system Oscillates. Social status and class conflicts begin to cycle predictably.
(r>3.6\): The system is Chaotic. Traditional hierarchies break down; bureaucracies and legal systems fail to regulate behavior. 

3. The "Compatibility Gap" (Structural Chaos) In social systems specifically, chaos is often measured as a Compatibility Gap between the layers of your tree logic. 
 THE COMPATIBILITY GAP (Macro-Level Stress)
   ChaosFactor = [ResourceDemand_Macro] / [SocialCohesion_Micro+Meso]
   (Measures the stress between State demands and Family/Kin stability)

High Ratio: When the State (Macro) demands more than the Family/Clan (Micro/Meso) can provide, the "Chaos Factor" spikes, leading to structural failure or revolution

	[Enounter Rate Formula - for Pc (Speech chance encouter rate - random attacks a rare and  understandale (animals, robberies, assassins)->

			[For npc determines event probability]

The document provides a formula to determine the expected number of people encountered (E) in a given area, using population density (D) and area (A):

E = D × A

*   D: Population density (people per unit of area).
*   A: The area covered by the search range (e.g., πr² for a circular radius r).

To calculate the actual probability (P) of meeting at least one person, assuming random distribution, the document refers to the Poisson distribution formula:

P(X = k) = (λᵏ * e⁻ᶝ) / k!

*   λ (Lambda): The average number of events in the interval (calculated as D × A).
*   k: The specific number of occurrences you are testing for (e.g., meeting exactly one person).

The probability of meeting at least one person is 1 - P(meeting 0 people).

### 1. Poison Potency Formula (LD50 Metric)

Poison potency is most commonly quantified using the LD50 (Lethal Dose 50%) metric, which is the amount of substance per unit of body mass (e.g., mg/kg) required to kill half of a test population.

The formula used to estimate the LD50 value from experimental data is:

LD50 = (ED50 / 3) * Wm * 10^-4 mg/kg

*   `ED50`: The effective dose for 50% of the population.
*   `Wm`: The individual's weight in grams.

---

### 2. Corrosion Potency Formula (Rate of Material Destruction)

Corrosion potency measures the rate at which material is lost over time, typically expressed in millimeters per year (mm/y).

The standard engineering formula to calculate the corrosion rate is:

Corrosion Rate (mm/y) = 87.6 * (W / (D * A * T))

*   `W`: Weight loss in milligrams.
*   `D`: Material density in grams per cubic centimeter.
*   `A`: Area of the sample in square centimeters.
*   `T`: Time of exposure in hours.
*   `87.6`: A unit conversion constant.


Poison Damage (LD50 approach):

Poison_Damage_Per_Turn = (Poison_Potency / Target_Mass) × (1 - Target_Poison_Res%)
Where:

Poison_Potency = LD50 value (mg/kg scaled to game units)
Target_Mass = character weight
Target_Poison_Res% = (Conditioning Poison Res stat)
Cell Damage (Corrosion approach):

Code
Cell_Damage_Per_Turn = (Poison_Potency / Target_Mass) × Corrosion_Rate × (1 - Target_Poison_Res%) × Time_Exposed
Where:

Corrosion_Rate = how aggressively poison degrades cells (Corrosive vs Irritant vs Systemic)
Time_Exposed = cumulative exposure (compounds damage)

Resistance% = Resistance_Stat / (Resistance_Stat + 100)
Final_Damage = Base_Damage × (1 - Resistance%)

SKILL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: THEORETICAL VS. PRACTICAL
============================================================

1. BASE FLAT GAIN (The Input)
------------------------------------------------------------
Every skill-related action generates a raw Base_XP value.
Formula:
Base_XP = Action_Difficulty_Value * Time_Invested_Constant

Recommended Base_XP Units:
- Simple Task: 5 XP
- Standard Task: 10 XP
- Complex/Dangerous Task: 25 XP


2. THEORETICAL GAIN (Knowledge Ceiling)
------------------------------------------------------------
Represents conceptual understanding. This is always trained.
Formula:
Knowledge_XP_Gain = Base_XP * Aptitude * Tier_Multiplier

Tier_Multipliers (Status):
- Major: x1.20
- Minor: x1.15
- Misc:  x1.08


3. PRACTICAL GAIN (Proficiency/Muscle Memory)
------------------------------------------------------------
Represents the ability to execute. It "drains" Potential.
Formula:
Proficiency_XP_Gain = Base_XP * Aptitude * Theoretical_Skill_Modifier

Note: The Theoretical_Skill_Modifier should be higher when 
Theoretical Skill >> Proficiency (The "Catch-up" Bonus).


4. POTENTIAL DYNAMICS (The Battery)
------------------------------------------------------------
Potential represents the "room for growth" before you hit 
your current knowledge ceiling.

Potential_Loss Calculation:
Potential_XP_Current = Potential_XP_Max - Proficiency_XP_Total

As Potential_XP_Current approaches 0, Proficiency_XP_Gain 
is throttled (Simulationist Merit: You cannot practice what 
you do not understand).


5. EXPONENTIAL LEVELING (The Curve)
------------------------------------------------------------
Formula:
XP_Needed_For_Next_Level = Base_XP_Threshold * (Level * Exponential_Factor)

Note: Apply this to both Knowledge and Proficiency bars 
separately to maintain the dual-track progression.


6. SKILL DECAY (The Rust)
------------------------------------------------------------
Formula:
P_Loss = Base_Decay_Rate * (1 - (Muscle_Memory_Score / 100))

Variables:
- Base_Decay_Rate: Flat amount lost per time unit (Day/Turn).
- Muscle_Memory_Score: Calculated based on your total 
  Proficiency level (High proficiency = Lower decay).


============================================================
          TRACK SKILL FORMULAS [SIMPLIFIED]
============================================================

CONSTANT:
G (Flat Gain Rate) = 5 

1. THEORETICAL EVOLUTION (Knowledge)
------------------------------------------------------------
Knowledge represents the "Ceiling" (K). It is always trained 
at the full rate allowed by your Aptitude and Tier.

ΔK = G * Aptitude * M_tier

Variables:
- M_tier (Major) = 1.20
- M_tier (Minor) = 1.15
- M_tier (Misc)  = 1.08


2. POTENTIAL CAPACITY (The Buffer)
------------------------------------------------------------
Potential (P) is the mathematical difference between what you 
understand (K) and what you can do (Proficiency, Φ).

P = K_level - Φ_level

Note: If P ≤ 0, ΔΦ is throttled to a "Stagnation Rate" (e.g., 0.1) 
because you have reached the limit of your current theory.


3. PRACTICAL EVOLUTION (Proficiency)
------------------------------------------------------------
Proficiency (Φ) gains faster when you have high "Theoretical 
Lead" (Potential).

ΔΦ = G * Aptitude * (1 + P)

Simulationist Merit: As Φ increases and P falls, the rate of 
ΔΦ naturally slows down, simulating the difficulty of 
mastering a concept you barely understand.


4. POTENTIAL DEpletion (The Cost of Action)
------------------------------------------------------------
Your innate potential is "consumed" as it is converted into 
permanent proficiency (Muscle Memory).

ΔP = ΔK - ΔΦ

Note: Usually, ΔΦ will be larger than ΔK when you are 
practicing, leading to a net loss in Potential until 
you stop to study (K-training).


5. PRACTICAL DECAY (Rust)
------------------------------------------------------------
Only affects Proficiency (Φ). Knowledge (K) is permanent.

ΔΦ_rust = -Base_Decay * (1 - (MM / 100))

Variables:
- MM (Muscle Memory Score): A value derived from 
  (Φ_total_xp / K_total_xp). 
  Higher MM = Lower Rust.


6. LEVEL THRESHOLD (The Curve)
------------------------------------------------------------
The XP required to move from Level (n) to (n+1).

XP_req = Base_XP * (n * E)

Variables:
- E (Exponential Factor): Determines how steep the 
  difficulty curve climbs.
