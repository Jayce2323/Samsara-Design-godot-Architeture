				Summon - No-Contract-Summons: Elemental-Nature determines the Elemental-Type that can be summoned or the Nature of the Clone summoned. [Clone-Nature determines - The effect produce when summoned, composition of Clone, and any effects Clone may produce, [*note: Shadow & Mirror-Clones = effect when summoned. Mimic-Clone: Effect when dispelled.]]
						Contract-Summons: Object: Unbound: Elemental-Nature determines the effect produce when summoned, and the medium the object must be summoned through/from.
									   Bound: Removes Nature Effects
								  Entity: Elemental-Nature determines the medium the object must be summoned through/from and the effect produce when summoned. [Animal & Spirit summons can either activate the effect or absorb and gain the proprties of the Element.(Difficulty determined by mass) ]
						No Contract Summons: 
							[Elemental-Nature:	[Summons: Clone [Mimic-Summon, Shadow-Summon, Mirror-Summon] or Elemental (Form: Humanoid or Wisp)
									1 - [Elementals: An Elemental does not need a Contract to be summoned. 
											[A "Marriage"/Joining Contract can be made with a Summoned Elemental for instant Mastery (All skills learned, bonus power to cast) of that Nature at the cost of being unable to use any other Elemental Nature-Magic.
												Under this contract the Elemental's Lifeforce(Vp), health(HP), and Stamina are merged [permanently.]
												This Contract is Single cast/Continuous meaning it is irreversible {even through causal-means}. This is the only Contract that can be made with an Elemental, and if Married to an Elemental it is the only Summonable Elemental.
												After Marriage to an Elemental, every skill-point gained in Summoning grants a chance to spawn "Children".
												Child: A child is an Elemental/Human Spirit hybrid that function as a Elemental & Clone. If Character Main Element = Elemental-element -> Child -Has same affinity and x2 power/skill(in that element) as the character/parents]
																							  If Character Main Element ≠ Elemental-element -> Child -Has Duel affinity and x1.5 power/skill(in a chosen element) from the character/parents]

												Elementals-Summoned (by Nature-Cast) - Water: Can Summon  Air & Water  
	    															       Fire: Can Summon Air & Fire
	    															       Air/Wind: Can Summon Air, Fire, & Water
	    															       Lightning: Can Summon  Air, Earth, Fire, & Water
            															       Earth: Can Summon Earth, Fire, & Water			
				 												       Wood: Can Summon	Air, Earth, & Water		
            			  												       Metal: Can Summon Air, Earth, & Fire,			
									
									2 - [Clone: Clones are made of the select Element but functionally have the same skill as the player[Pulse determines the # of copies made.]
											Summonable Clones are split into 3 types: Mimic, Shadow, Mirror
													Mimic-Clone: Mimic-Clones clones with no skills. Can resemble any thing/object the caster can mold. These are mainly used for quick subterfuge [distractions and substitutions][Functions as Counter/Reaction]
													Shadow-Clones:  A copy that possesses the user’s exact Body-Stats and Skills. Since Clone is copy of character Magnitude will determine Hp of Clone, with specific stats[denisty, volume] being set through the Nature-Modifiers. 
																Shadow Clones are capable of indepent operation and upon disperal break down into the element they are composed of. Futhermore the caster gains any aquired knowledge, and regains any VP unspent by the clone.
																	*NOTE: Ki pool (VP) is split between Shadow-Summons. Meaning 1 Shadow-summon = 50% ki for caster + 50% ki for S-s, 2 = 33.333% split and so on]
													Mirror-Clone: a specialized entity that acts as an extension of the user. The Mirror clone can act independently or mirror the casters movement. The Mirror Clone has its own Spell-set seperate from the caster. Health and stats are shared among the caster and Mirror clone
																*If Mirror-Clone is Summoned, a Contract is made and becomes the only Summon the Caster can call.]
					
						Contract - [(seal-section)- Contract seals function as a target-setter for the Contract-spell it self. The Spell-itself works through exchanging "Aether" between Caster and the Target, (Works like a magentic bond that can be turned on-off or weakened)]
							[Tether - Tethering is the "exchange of Aether" in Contracting, but in this sense it is used when the Caster-gives their Energy to an object and takes none from it. Tethering the "Contract" to that object alone.]

						Contract Summons: [Summons: Object-Summon (Bound, Unbound), Enity-Summons [People, Animals [Normal, Sage], Spirits, Monsters, Sentient-Objects]

								1 - Object-Summons: [Unbound-Object - Summoned directly by the catser through the "Contract"]
											[Bound-Object - Caster can apply the Contract for an object to another object. This removes the contract from the caster letting anyone who holds the bound-item and capable of summoning call the item.]

								2 - Enity-Summons: Enitity Summons are always summonable directly by the caster a but can be bound to items for multi-activation/summoning]	

						Conjure - Elemental-Nature determines the medium the object must be conjured through/from and the effect produce when Conjured. [ can either activate the effect or absorb and gain the proprties of the Element.(Difficulty determined by mass) ]

						Stregthen/Weaken - Effects Caster's control over the Selected nature and body-part connecte to that nature. [See Unified-Element Chart]

						Illusion - Creates Illusion and Ilusory effect of Element [alters mood]

						Percieve - Elemental-Nature Reveals Chakra-points and directly conntected body-part-info for Entities. For Objects shows stats linked to that Nature.						 - 

						Control - Allows for control over that element in associated target.

						Seal - [Protective - Protects from Opposing-Element attuned in Seal ie - Fire Seal protects Wood, is strengthened by air [see U-E chart]
							[Binding - Seals Nature or Connected body part
							[Tracking - Shares the input from connected body-part]
							[Contract - see Summons*]

						Displace - Attunes spell to move chosen Element [Every element of chosen target doesnt have to be chosen just a majority. ex sword - metal  or metal and wood would both suffice to be able to displace it. a Person = 7/7 Elements + Aether= 8 so atleast 5 of those categories would have to be selected to displace a person and "Metal" would need to be included to ensure refined items outside of Earth catergory ]

						Transmute - Sets Element to be Transmuted

						Barrier/Domain - Set Properties inside Barrier/Domain
						
						Container - Set Properties of container

Gel-Hardness
While an official table does not exist, engineers use general reference points to compare these scales. Almost all materials measured on Shore scales (rubbers and plastics) fall below Mohs 3. 
Material Example 	Shore Scale Value	Estimated Mohs Equivalent
Gels / Soft Rubbers	< 40 Shore A	< 1 Mohs
Pencil Eraser	~50 Shore A	~1 Mohs
Shoe Sole / Tire Tread	~70 Shore A	1.5 – 2 Mohs
Hard Hat / Golf Ball	~90 Shore A / 50 Shore D	~2 Mohs (Fingernail level)
Bowling Ball / Hard Plastic	~80 Shore D	2.5 – 3 Mohs (Copper penny level)
Nylon / Polycarbonate	~85 Shore D	~3 Mohs
Why they are difficult to compare
Material Type: Shore scales are designed specifically for polymers (rubbers/plastics), while Mohs is used for minerals and inorganic solids.
Elasticity: Rubbers are "resilient"; they can resist a scratch (Mohs) but be easily indented (Shore). Conversely, a material like gypsum is harder to indent but easy to scratch.
Measurement Range: The entire 0–100 Shore A and Shore D ranges typically fit into just the first three steps of the 1–10 Mohs scale. 

Comparison of Common Materials
Material Type 	Hardness Scale	Typical Value
Soft Gel (Insole)	Shore OO	30
Gummy Bear	Shore OO	10
Hard Cosmetic Gel	Mohs / Shore D	~2.5 Mohs / 70-80 Shore D
Silica Gel (Solid)	Mohs	6
Talc (Softest Mineral)	Mohs	1

*Free-Body Model [For tracking Force-Source and Output][Need to review and further integration]

Godot 4.5, modeling a "Free-Body Diagram" (FBD) for a turn-based game involves creating a Force Accumulator script. Unlike real-time physics which resolve instantly, a turn-based FBD needs to store, inspect, and then process forces as discrete steps.
1. Data Structure: The Force Object
Create a custom resource or a simple class to store force data. This allows you to track not just the magnitude, but the source (e.g., "Wind," "Recoil," "Grapple").
gdscript
class_name GameForce
var vector: Vector2
var source: String
var type: String # e.g., "Impulse", "Constant"

func _init(v: Vector2, s: String = "Unknown"):
    vector = v
    source = s
Use code with caution.

2. The Accumulator Model
Attach a script to your units that manages a list of these forces. Instead of applying them directly to velocity, you store them in a buffer to be resolved at the end of a turn or phase.
Force Buffer: A list of GameForce objects.
Net Force Calculation: The vector sum of all active forces.
Resolution: In a turn-based context, you typically resolve these into a final grid displacement rather than continuous motion. 
gdscript
# Attach to your unit
var active_forces: Array[GameForce] = []

func add_force(force_vec: Vector2, source: String):
    active_forces.append(GameForce.new(force_vec, source))

func get_net_force() -> Vector2:
    var net = Vector2.ZERO
    for f in active_forces:
        net += f.vector
    return net

func resolve_turn_movement():
    var net_force = get_net_force()
    # Logic to convert net_force (e.g., 500.0) to grid tiles (e.g., 2 tiles)
    # Use your existing movement logic here to apply the result
    active_forces.clear() # Reset for next turn
Use code with caution.

3. Handling Tile-Based Constraints
Since you are using a grid, your FBD model must account for "Static Resistance" from tiles:
Static Friction: Ignore net forces below a certain threshold to prevent minor nudges from moving a unit.
Collision Feedback: When a force pushes a unit into a wall tile, you can "cancel" that component of the force vector by checking the TileMapLayer for collision data before final resolution. 


*Vector Travel & Plane Splitting Model To calculate velocity by plane, you must decompose the net force into Parallel (Tangent) and Perpendicular (Normal) components relative to your movement planes (e.g., floor, walls, or specific grid axes). Normal Component: The force pushing into the plane (used for friction or blocking).Tangent Component: The force along the plane (used for actual travel velocity). gdscript# Core math for splitting a travel vector by a plane normal
func split_by_plane(force: Vector2, plane_normal: Vector2) -> Dictionary:
    var normal_component = force.project(plane_normal)
    var tangent_component = force - normal_component
    return {
        "normal": normal_component,  # The 'Impact' or 'Compression'
        "tangent": tangent_component  # The 'Travel' or 'Slide'
    }
Use code with caution.2. Force-to-Velocity Conversion (The "Free-Body" Accumulator) In a turn-based system, velocity is a discrete calculation of \((\sum \text{Forces})/\text{Mass}\) applied over a "turn-step" rather than a continuous frame. Mass/Inertia: Higher mass reduces the resulting travel vector.Friction by Plane: Apply different dampening to the tangent component based on the tile type (e.g., ice vs. mud). gdscriptfunc calculate_turn_velocity(forces: Array[Vector2], mass: float, plane_normal: Vector2) -> Vector2:
    var net_force = Vector2.ZERO
    for f in forces:
        net_force += f
        
    var split = split_by_plane(net_force, plane_normal)
    
    # 1. Resolve Normal: If pushing into a wall/floor, it may be nullified
    var resolved_normal = Vector2.ZERO # Assume plane is solid
    
    # 2. Resolve Tangent: Apply mass and friction
    var acceleration = split.tangent / mass
    var turn_velocity = acceleration # This is your 'travel vector' for the turn
    
    return turn_velocity
Use code with caution.3. Structural Integration To integrate this into your existing movement logic: Force Collection Phase: During the turn, actions (recoil, wind, explosions) add Vector2 forces to a unit's force_buffer.Decomposition Phase: Before moving, use the split_by_plane logic against your tile's collision normals.Output to Movement: Pass the final turn_velocity to your movement function (e.g., your move_to_tile() or lerp logic). Godot 4.5 Tip: If you are using CharacterBody2D for your units, you can use the PhysicsDirectBodyState2D to query tile normals automatically without manual raycasting, allowing for more accurate plane splitting when hitting diagonal or irregular tiles.
