Social Sim- *Psyche explnin Magic doc

Major Note (specifically for code/cache considerations)- idea: Control through Single actors & character sheet. flow of all systems Intent->Expression->Reactions
							unecessary forward on philosphy so it doesnt haveto be restated: As much as content as possible should function through generation. all design i mapped around that which is why formulas do not and should not contain specific values. The generated world contains the values in the appropriate pieces (Chars, tiles, objects).
							The challenge is managing the load of generating/storing/and load said data points effeciently and coherently. Generation is themost theorectical therefore the easiest to tackle up front. if not explictly mentioned, "method for saving" (whether or not data should be saved) should be implied.
							Thesis: Information, and events are generated on "NEED TO(KNOW)" basis, unknown info remains ungenerated. Individually character sheets are pulled from for generation. ie. pc family pulled from PC card index. Pc companion family is the same. That doesnt spawn anything, just flags for generation in sceneraio where appropriate. i was gonna explain in greater detail but i ended up linking the rest of the systems and lost steam.

General princple of hierarchy - Like interacts with like. Individuals interact with individuals, kin with kin, states with states etc with Socioeconomic being the determining factor of who is interacted with in matters.
				[not a hard sim rule rather it means that whatever lvl of hierarchy an interaction is made at resolves that issue. if opposing clansmen fight, that is now an inter-clan fight]
				[Inter-status conflict normally resolve with the higher rank prevailing, unless found to be fradulent, immoral, ethically-lacking, factually wrong (dependant),or deceitful . resolution depend on morality of resolver]
				The hierarchical position, in relation to ones social-status is the main determiner for the cause of social interaction	.
				General structure is Ingroup/outgroup: strong loyalty/suspicion of rival clans but I reversed for the Subversive (individual who counters the norm/inverses one oe mor collective principals/goals) where Ingroup/outgroup: suspicion of peers/strong loyalty to rival clans
																	Deceiptive (individual who hides subversive or deviant nautre)
																	Deviant (individual who's goal breaks taboo )
																	Liar (Pa = compelled to lie(habit))(So = to manipulate for gain)(Na = Lies for Ego)
																		(Co = Small lies)(Oc = Lies to not be left out)(Imp = lies with out rregard for long term)
																		(Av = lies to hide private details or avoid conseqence/reaction)(Pro = lies to protect others)
																	Suspicion lvl (instinctual supicion of person based on witnessed behaivor and known info. 
																		Suspicion represents that charachters chances of being a Subversive, Deceiptive, Deviant, Liar, Charlatan, or Infiltrator  )
																	Pessimist (individual who responds negatively to positive speech-type)
																	Optimist (Individual who repsonds positively to negative speech-type)
				
				Goal-structure is inverse. Individuals have complex-goals and simple methods. As the hierarchy moves up the goals-become simpler/focus and the methods more complex
					*Ingroup-outgroup - as hierarchry lvl rise suspicion between unknown in group memebers rise. ie (situation with no proof, and out of character (action does not equal habit)) 
								inter-family suspicion 5-10% for known family member if outof character (action does not equal habit) vs
								20-25% suspicion for unknown kin; however if fellow Statesman:  20-25% suspicion for known Statesman and no other association vs
								5-10% suspicion known Statesman and kinsman (implies/ clansman) vs  50-70% suspicion for known Statesman and unknown clan

Social-Tracking - . 

	MICRO LEVEL (Individual → Family → Kin) - needs, preferences, and daily life happen
		(work is social)	
						Individual - Drives: hunger, safety, comfort, belonging, ambition, Social radius: neighbors, coworkers, peers,
						Family (Direct): Core functions: Support (resource sharing, protection, inheritance, early socialization (Early habit formation)
						Kin (Extended): Core functions: alliance building, marriage ties, shared reputation, shared obligations,

	MESO LEVEL (Clan → Religion(social)/guild(work)) - identity, tradition, and collective memory.

						Clan: Collective goals: survival, legacy, territory, propagation, Practices: naming conventions, rites of passage, marriage rules, alliances through marriage (incorparation of acceptable out-groups)
						Religion: Collective goals: moral order, cosmology, ritual stability, Practices: ceremonial food, funerary rites, fasting/feasting,taboos, 
								-Ingroup/outgroup:believers vs non‑believers (religious out group), sects vs sects (religous in-group/Clan-outgroup)

. 	MACRO LEVEL (State → Class/Status) - military/large collectivist-power, law, and economy

						State / Country: Collective goals: stability (Resource security, Territory management, Population control), Practices: taxation, military service, festivals, legal systems
								Ingroup/outgroup: citizens vs foreigners, guilds vs guilds, factions vs factions
						Social Status / Class / Stratification: Socioeconomic rating, Determines: who you can marry, who you can trade with, who you can speak to, who you can employ,who you can command
									Status is influenced by: Legacy (wealth, occupation/occupational success, lineage, reputation)- every individual social-structure has shared Legacy


Morality: note*(for morality an all social concepts)- [Morality should not reflect the characters belief, but how others see the characters actions. a theif sees a hero as the villian, the vitcim does not.]

Influence - the "political" currency ->[need formula] Modifies Socioeconomic-status/Used for favors and add weight in group decisions.	

Prestige - Percieved Combat ranking. Base on Weapon Skills/Moves -> Combos -> Multistage moves. Combos can be made freely, learned from others, or taught to those who want to learn, or learn through "Osmosis". Combos Shared with others have shared prestige lvl (tracked through Dissappation method)
            Prestige = Combat Score - Sum of all Combo Lvls [A combos prestige rating/stats only trained in actual battle against Npc and must have witness to move use Prestige gain - For every hit/attack of combo landed x dmg of attack, all combos gain prestige on win  [Loser Prestige - Victor Prestige = Prestige earned for each combo if x = 0 or less than "no change"]/ 
																			Prestige Loss - Whiffed [every hit/attack of combo missed x number of consecutive-attacks missed], all combos lose prestige on defeat [Victor Prestige - Loser Prestige = Prestige earned for each combo if x = 0 or less than "no change"]
         Combo Stats = Stamina Cost- Stamina lost if Combo is completed flawlessy with no resistance
			  School - Name of fighting Style. Must Name style if unique (Styles with shared names from seperate creators will share prestige)
			  Master - Leader of School (Faction)
			  Creator - Character who made Combo

Prestige lvl - [Higher than Tracked prestige] = Skill level -> This is the social representation of your skill stat. It determines your percieved item/work quality, and influences you comes to you and why. 
        
		[Just in case it unclear Prestige track Pc's Social (percieved) Job and Trainer Lvl for NPCs -> As  a Pc would do inversely]	


Socialization -

Functions as more traditional turn-based combat. Can have random encounters. Affected by mood.

Conversation-parts - Subject: Convo type - Topic 
      		  Intent/Speech-type: Bartering, Intimidation, Coercion, Persuasion, Argumentaion, Commanding (Ordering), Negotiation, Interrogation, Inquiry, Narration, Description, Exposition, Prasising, Pleading, Mockery
		     Tone-Setting: Action-type: Hostile(Crits enhance "dmg"), Deceptive, Neutral, Friendly (crits reduce "dmg" (overfriendly)), Action-effect: Negative-Defend, Positive-Attack
                     
			stats - Pyshce: Logos, Pathos, Ethos - these represent the ability to reason and are your social resource. Every character responds positively (Enhances Friendly speech), neutrally(Enhances deception), and negatively(Enhances hostile effect) to one of these.
				
Convo flow (after initial intent) - 1. Initiator (set intent) vs Respondent (Free to set own intent/Resist[start battle]/or agree [conversation resolves])
				 Fight- Initiator (argument: Stat-type [Logos]+Tone[Hostile]+Effect[Positive]) - Respondent (argument: Stat-type [Pathos]+Tone[Hostile]+Effect[Positive]) = x
						Inititor: Losses 1 logos to attack					Respondent: Losses 1 pathos to attack = Resolution determined by Speech Skill + Tone + Effect
																				The higher number wins that round and the difference in score is subtacted from the losers stats resource

Convo-Goal by speech type - Hostile (overwhelm oppenent reduce psyche/ force submission)
			    Deceptive (Hide motive/intent or info without lying. [True intent unknown])

				*[Npcs should have prefered psyche min-max to avoid regular-prolonged conversations, and early player-psyche drain.]

       Mood - is tied to [Emotional State = Logos, Pathos, Ethos] -> Determines available conversation options (Pc/NPc), and Event Reactions(NPc) [Determined in probability and scale] [E.State Tracking - e.states "hp" starts at 0 (respresenting emotional balance) average char limit per state = 50(capped in bot directions -50<0>+50) with no other consideration aside from base stats]
									Ex. - Logos -> Low(25% down from 0) = Irrational [Pc- Gains Boost to speech types opposite from character by % lost (inthiscase:25% bonus effect/dmg)]
										Logos -> Low(25% up from 0) = Irrational [Pc- Gains Boost to speech types opposite from character by % gained (inthiscase:25% bonus effect/dmg)]
										reaching-cap: reaching a stat cap and using that action intiates a "Closer" 100% bonus but conversation ends. [If conversation ends and new convo is started before stat begins regen -> allow "exploit" of loop. this can be a freak out or straight bullying tactic.]
												[Overkill: any dmgover psyche limitis multiplied by disperity between dmg dealt and limit by which cap was exceeded]
										Sense regen = stamina regen
										Mood -> Disposition = [dmg dealt-dmg taken] x [mood % (+/-)]= Disposition chng

*[Excessive gift giving, Batering with nothing in return, over Bartering intentionally, should trigger suspicion for pc actions specifically, but as general rule (prevents tactics like outright buying all food and waiting out a Siege)]				


*[Recruitment Party & Warband - Pc has 2 party slots Mainslot: Companions, Secondary: Mercenaries
											Slots:	Companions: Fuction as direct/party members [Might have to lower but set cap to 12]
												Mercenary: Hired units that travel with the Pc as allied units but do not generate-sim stats outside of function combat stats. [Might have to lower but set cap to 20]
													*Mercenaries can be hired as Companions to retain their paid role, and will "freely choose" whether to leave the player once contract is up. Mecenaries will automatically fill Companion slot if <_4 companions
														*As well Companions are Autonomous and can leave the party freely, or demand payment for joing you as a companion if they "see it as" mercenary work]
[Settlement-Building - Mercenaries also count as Workers. As long as their paid they'll do the job. Merc/Workers with : Slave or Servant tag can not be paid in currency and will take rations only. All party members must be fed.(Daily), though Merc/Workers or companions can be assigned to handle this as well
			Shared containers, area partitioning [unsure what it called but CDDA,Elin,Amazing CultSim all do it]] will be used to keep party and personal item seperate. Npcs will do the same. 

			Workers party and non party may settle the areas they're building but as settlers they'll only follow the one in charge, so if you build a farm that's leased you may get neighbors whose placement cant directly be controlled. (though gernetaion should/would ideally have a logic map)
			Security - The owner of a settlement/ments provides the troops for security through the party slots as well. Garrison spliting {into Standing-marching troops} can be handled by leaving troops with Substitute  who gains the other 50% party slots (just in case Sub is a companion with party already).
					Multi-settlement security: Same principle. Through "Diplomacy" you can ask a companion to swear fealty. once sworn they be granted land or a settlement of their own that you currently own or come into possesion of. 
									Companion gains the other 50% party slots and can operate an army and settlement as the Pc does.									
max-party cap = 1064 (player not included)-[Max party size for battles, if battle is long/deadly enough for reinforcement charge they will enter map from direction of travel of party and be counted as world adjacent to local tile-probabbly over explain]
	
				Companions gets party slots as well - Slots: Companion: 6 each
										Mercenary: 10 each


*[unsure if contradictory notes exist- hardrule- Companions and mercs do no have to be in vicinity to be in party. Mercenary slots are static. Non vicinity Companion slots are cached and replace with up to 6 new slots. new companions must be sent from vinicity (or outright dismissed from party)]
*[rule 2*- Mecenary/freelancer title changes with hired job role. Party companions can be interracted with Merc/freelancers cannot, but companions can be freely moved between the 2 slots. 
		Companions: act as friends (share indv group faction identity/unpaid/shared rewards), 
		Merc/Frees: acts as Guards (must already be part of faction, convert, or be made companion (for atleast 2  weeks[Social system can lower]) to share indv group faction identity)/Paid- system for ingratiating soliders][integrates soliders/labor]


*rumors/gossip: stream line solution.  all tracked components work like stats that update every individual interaction. if a charcter sees you kill it updates that witnesses morality (their view of you), get the raduis the pc opreated in over a day. avg # of ppl. avg social score for all categories. that will modify a dissaption rate and set how "long it takes for word to spread" or let the set the update rate
				per system rule, if witness is unknown, or known but current dispostion unknown, or Known current dispostion known and npc does not plan to speak of what they saw, the auto update skips and both actions are held in the buffer till the pc leaves "that npcs bubble"

Breeding/Trait [Animals/Marriage]- [2 sets -1 from each parent. only one is rolled by Pc on char-creation]
1. Autosomes (Pairs 1–22)
These carry instructions for general body development and functions[affects Max lvl treshold]. 
Chromosome 1: Power = Strength + Dexterity = How much force the character generates
Chromosome 2: Accuracy = Perception + Dexterity = Charcters hand eye coordination skill
Chromosome 3: Charisma = Perception + Intellingence = Characters social awareness 
Chromosome 4: Stamina = Strength + Endurance = The amount of energy a character can exert at once 
Chromosome 5: Toughness = Willpower + Strength = How much damage a characters body can absorb
Chromosome 6: Quickness = Dexterity + Endurance = How well the character can navigate spacial movement
Chromosome 7: Resilience = Willpower + Percpetion = How well the character can guard against mental attacks &/or recover from them.
Chromosome 8: Muscle Memory = (Intelligence + Endurance + Dexterity)/1.5 = Governs skill retention and potential 
Chromosome 9: Aptitude = (Intelligence + Willpower + Perception)/1.5= How well the character can learn a skill, execute, and or strategize 
Chromosome 10: Constitution/Lifeforce [Qi/Ki/Chakra] = Willpower + Endurance = Represents the characters pysche and body (soul).
Chromosome 11: Metabolism - fat and Muscle threshold
Chromosome 23: Sex Chromosome

These carry instructions for Advantages-Disadvantages [Phenotype = Build, Appearance, Race, Genetic-Conditions, Genetic-Mutations]-  Can Slot = [Any chromosome with Effect]
Chromosome 12: Power = Can Slot [Power, Accuracy, Stamina, Toughness, Quickness, Muscle-Memory]
Chromosome 13: Accuracy = Can Slot [Power, Accuracy, Charisma, Quickness, Resilience, Muscle-Memory, Aptitude]
Chromosome 14: Charisma = Can Slot [Accuracy, Charisma, Resilience, Muscle-Memory, Aptitude]
Chromosome 15: Stamina = Can Slot [Power, Stamina, Toughness, Quickness, Muscle-Memory, Constitution]

Chromosome 22: Metabolism = Can Slot Any Chromosome and applies Effect (as is)[Chance slot for defect or mutation]

[Trait Rolling & Genetic-Mutations - For Pc/on char-creation Chromosome slots are filled in order [random or by player]. 
rule+ex. Chromosome 12: Power =  Can Slot [Power, Accuracy, Stamina, Toughness, Quickness, Muscle-Memory]
				 (Power)  [If slot has only matching "effect" -> No Mutation is rolled -> Take advantage/No disadvantage]
				 (Power + Con) [If slot filled with at least one matching "effect" -> No Mutation is rolled -> Take advantage/No disadvantage]
				 (Power + Accuracy) [If slot filled with matching "effect" & adjacent slot "effect" macth -> No Mutation is rolled -> Take advantage/No disadvantage/ +5% to adjacent slot stat](can be cancelled-out)

				 (Charisma + Resilience ) [If slot filled with 2 "non-can-fill"-> Chance Mutation is rolled -> Take advantage & disadvantage]
				   -> If slot filled with 2 "non-can-fill"-> Next slot becomes adjacent slot to nearest "can-fill"
		if Power = Disadvantage-> If adjacent slot rolls disadvantage after rolling disadvantage-> Chance Mutation is rolled -> Both disadvantage become advantage]
		and Accuracy = Disadvantage
		Chance Mutations = Genes roll with _,_,_,or_ tags. If gene tag = natural state & "Chance Mutation" is rolled successful -> Mutation is summed/scored & stored (ex.+5% Power, +5% Constitution,=+10) until Chromosome 22 is rolled.
					-> After Chromosome 22 is rolled the "Chance Mutation" with the highest score checked for tag -> If trait = Dominant - trait is applied, Recessive - requires both parents
																			De-novo - Chance roll, X-Linked & male - apply (+Female for High Fantasy mode)
					->If first "Chance Mutation trait" ≠ Dominant, check for next trait until Chromosome 22 or dominant trait is found. 
					->If Dominant trait found, apply trait to Chromosome 22 (if from dfferent slot), and re-roll old slot. [Only applies Advantage/disadvantage & slot %. {Change slot rule not applied}]
					->If more than 1 Dominant trait found, apply highest score trait to Chromosome 22 (if from dfferent slot), and re-roll old slot.->Roll remaining mutations for proc-chance

Inheritance Type 	Probability if Both Parents "Carry"	Visible in Parent?

The basic conceptual formula for the expected number of people you might encounter in a given range is: 
(E= D (x)A) 
Where: (E): Expected number of people encountered.
(D): Population density (people per unit of area, e.g., people per square mile).
(A): The area covered by your search "range" (typically \(\pi r^{2}\) for a circular radius \(r\)). 

Calculating the Probability of Meeting at Least One Person To find the actual probability ((P)) of meeting at least one person, 
assuming people are distributed randomly (often modeled using a Poisson distribution), the formula is: 
             λᵏ * e⁻ᶝ
P(X = k) = —————————————
                  k!
(P(X=k)\): The probability of (k) events occurring.
 (Lambda): The average number of events in the given interval (calculated as Density × Area).
(e): Euler's number (approximately 2.71828).
(k): The actual number of occurrences you are testing for (e.g., meeting exactly 1 person, 2 people, etc.).
(k!): The factorial of \(k\). This represents the probability of not finding zero people in the specified area.


Simplified Ratio Method If you are looking for the probability of meeting one specific person out of a total population ((N)) within a lifetime or specific timeframe, the basic ratio is: 
P=Interactions\Total-Population

The World Hierarchical Scale
Active (Embark) Tile: The smallest unit where actual characters and items exist.
Local Block: A 48 x 48 cluster of active tiles.
Region Tile: A 16 x 16 cluster of Local Blocks. This means one Region Tile contains 768 x 768 individual active tiles.

Chaos factor Note- Formula:

The most common ways to represent the Chaos Factor mathematically are through Lyapunov Exponents (to measure sensitivity) and Logistic Maps (to measure population-driven instability). 

1. The Sensitivity Formula (Lyapunov Exponent) This formula calculates how quickly a small change at the Micro level (e.g., a family dispute) can spiral into a Macro level crisis (e.g., social unrest). 
. 		THE SENSITIVITY FORMULA (Micro-Level Drift): λ = lim (t→∞) [ (1/t) * ln |d(t) / d(0)| ]
   		(Measures how fast a small Micro change spirals into a Macro event)
		(Lambda): The Chaos Factor.\(d(0)\): Initial distance between two social states.
		(d(t)\): The distance between those states over time.Interpretation: If \(\lambda \) is positive, the system is chaotic. Even a tiny "Micro" change will eventually disrupt the entire "Macro" state. 

2. The Feedback Formula (Logistic Map) Used to predict when a Meso-level group (like a Clan or Religion) will become unstable due to resource competition or over-population. 
		THE FEEDBACK FORMULA (Meso-Level Instability)
   		X_next = r * X_current * (1 - X_current)
   		(Measures when Clan/Religious growth triggers systemic collapse)

		(x_{n}\): The current state of the system (between 0 and 1).
		(r\): The "growth rate" or Chaos Parameter.
Breakdown of \(r\):\(r<3.0\): The system is Stable. Families and Clans are in equilibrium.
(3.0<r<3.5\): The system Oscillates. Social status and class conflicts begin to cycle predictably.
(r>3.6\): The system is Chaotic. Traditional hierarchies break down; bureaucracies and legal systems fail to regulate behavior. 

3. The "Compatibility Gap" (Structural Chaos) In social systems specifically, chaos is often measured as a Compatibility Gap between the layers of your tree logic. 
 THE COMPATIBILITY GAP (Macro-Level Stress)
   ChaosFactor = [ResourceDemand_Macro] / [SocialCohesion_Micro+Meso]
   (Measures the stress between State demands and Family/Kin stability)

High Ratio: When the State (Macro) demands more than the Family/Clan (Micro/Meso) can provide, the "Chaos Factor" spikes, leading to structural failure or revolution

A. Formula for Chances of Running Into Each Other 
	[Enounter Rate Formula - for Pc (Speech chance encouter rate - random attacks a rare and  understandale (animals, robberies, assassins)->

			[For npc determines event probability]

The document provides a formula to determine the expected number of people encountered (E) in a given area, using population density (D) and area (A):

E = D × A

*   D: Population density (people per unit of area).
*   A: The area covered by the search range (e.g., πr² for a circular radius r).

To calculate the actual probability (P) of meeting at least one person, assuming random distribution, the document refers to the Poisson distribution formula:

P(X = k) = (λᵏ * e⁻ᶝ) / k!

*   λ (Lambda): The average number of events in the interval (calculated as D × A).
*   k: The specific number of occurrences you are testing for (e.g., meeting exactly one person).

The probability of meeting at least one person is 1 - P(meeting 0 people).


How to merge Journal/Quest/Convo ( text parsing)

Nouns: subjects, people (by social hierarchy), items (by type/known value in journal), places (by location type), events, relational terms.
Verbs: actions, intents, requests, emotional cues.
Adjectives: mood tags, descriptors (stats/traits modifiers), stat generators (Logos/Pathos/Ethos hints), relational tone.
Keywords: skill tags, topic tags, mood triggers.


Light Mode:
Player picks Intent + Tone (e.g., Persuade, Intimidate).
Button-based.
Fast, turn-based resolution.
"Social Pokémon battle" pacing.
Used for quick persuasion, intimidation, simple bartering, casual social checks.
No parsing.
The default mode.


Deep Mode:
Continues through the journal after opening intents.
Player can switch freely between Light and Deep at any time.
Uses parsed words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).
Optional, but provides mechanical benefits/bonuses.
Especially useful for specific bartering and relational detail.
Uses text input.
Parser activates, optionally showing small icons for bonuses (Logos/Pathos/Ethos).

Unlocks special moves (Hook B).
Expose Deception (triggered by probing motive/suspicion words).
Ask NPC Relational Detail (triggered by relational nouns/emotional adjectives).
Deep Mode Boosts Relationship (triggered by empathy/support verbs/personal topics).
Deep Mode equals skillful play and provides a roleplay bonus.

Journal stores topics as nodes (Bandit Camp, Missing Merchant, Trade Routes, etc.).
NPCs can "discuss" any topic they know about.
Player must log discovered topics/outcomes in Journal manually,by selecting from recent event [Output-log](Journal tab), 

Nouns -> topics, factions, items, people.
Verbs -> intents, actions, goals.
Adjectives -> mood, traits, stats.
Keywords -> skill tags.
Radiant quests generated from: NPC Goal, Obstacle, Location, Required Skill, Reward.
NPC goals come from personality/psyche/traits.

One step, low stakes, no continuity. Supports NPC's short-term needs. Examples: deliver message, gather info, fetch item.

Multi-step, high stakes, continuity across time.
Directly tied to NPC’s core goal.
Player becomes a helper, not a fetcher.
Examples: help NPC rise in faction, resolve a feud, achieve a long-term ambition.
