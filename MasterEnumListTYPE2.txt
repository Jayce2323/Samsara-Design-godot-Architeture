CLEANING (The Physical Build)
This type covers the mechanical removal of surface layers.
The Bristle Bundle:
Parts: Filaments (Wire/Fiber), Ferrule (The ring that holds them), Handle.
Logic: A multi-point contact tool for irregular surfaces.
The Flat Scraper:
Parts: Hardened Bevel (The edge), Shank, Grip.
Logic: A single-point contact tool for shearing off surface buildup.
GRIPPING (Force Multipliers)
Tools that use mechanical advantage to hold or twist.
The Pivot Assembly (Pliers/Tongs/Shears)
Parts: Fulcrum Bolt, Offset Handle, Work-Head (Jaws/Blades).
Logic: The "Grip" is just a lever-ratio calculation between the handle length and the head length.
The Screw-Clamp (Vise/C-Clamp)
Parts: Threaded Spindle, Traveling Block (The jaw that moves), Guide Rail (Prevents rotation), Fixed Stop.
Logic: Uses a Leadscrew to translate rotation into high-pressure linear clamping.
SHAPING (Abrasive/Refining)
Components that remove material or enforce geometry.
The Rotary Mandrel (Lathe/Drill)
Parts: Spindle, Drive Pulley/Crank, Chuck/Collet (The part that grips the workpiece or bit), Bearing Housing.
Logic: A high-speed rotating shaft that allows a Shaping bit to hit a workpiece evenly.
The Abrasive Surface (Files/Hones)
Parts: Hardened Face, Toothed Profile, Tang.
Logic: A surface with a higher Hardness value than the workpiece, used to "scrape" away material at a sub-millimeter level.
The Punch & Matrix (For Valves/Connectors):
Parts: Male Punch, Female Die-Plate, Guide Pins (for alignment).
Logic: These are the "Standardizers." They ensure every screw or valve-flap you make is a 1:1 physical match.
The Tap (For Internal Threads):
Parts: Threaded Flutes (The cutting teeth), Square Drive (The top for a wrench), Tapered Tip.
The Die (For External Threads/Screws):
Parts: Threaded Core, Adjustment Screw (to set depth), Die Stock (The handle frame).
PERFORATTING; The Tool: Punch & Drift or Aul.
The Parts: Hardened Point/Tip, Striking Face (the top), Tapered Body.
The Function: This is how you create the starter holes for your Rivets or the slots for Standardized Connectors in sheet metal.
SMELTING (Thermal & Material State)
Parts for containing or directing high-energy states.
The Air Displacement Unit (Bellows)
Parts: Compression Chamber (Expanding/collapsing volume), One-way Reed Valve (The flap), Directional Nozzle.
Logic: A mechanical pump used to force air (oxygen) into the Furnace to raise temperatures beyond a standard fire's limit.
The Casting Vessel (Crucible/Ladle)
Parts: Refractory Liner (Thermal resistance), Structural Shell (The frame that holds the liner), Shank (Long handle for distance from heat).
Logic: A container specifically rated to stay solid while its contents are liquid.
The Die/Matrix (Molds)
Parts: Cavity (The negative space), Alignment Pins (To ensure the two halves match), Pouring Basin.
Logic: A standardized "Negative" of a part used to replicate geometry exactly.


Fastener Shear & Stability (L/W/H Logic)
The stability of a Composite is determined by the Fastener Grade relative to the Part Dimensions.
Fastener	Physics Role	Strength Formula (Sim Logic)
Rivet	Shear Specialist	Strength = (Material_Hardness * Rivet_Area) * Vibration_Modifier(1.0)
Screw	Tension/Torque	Strength = (Thread_Depth * Clamp_Force) * Vibration_Modifier(0.8)
Stability Logic: Joint_Stability = (Sum_Fastener_Strength) / (Part_Mass * Distance_from_Center).
